# 1.2.1.5 Template Parts

**Overview**
**Template Parts** are essentially reusable blocks of layout that you can place inside multiple **HTML Templates**. They are the block theme equivalent of `get_header()`, `get_footer()`, or `get_template_part()`. Common examples include Headers, Footers, and Sidebars. By defining these global sections as individual files in the `parts/` directory, you ensure that changes made to the "Site Header" update instantly across every page that uses it. They are referenced inside templates using the `wp:template-part` block.

| **Section**                                 | **Interview Learning Goals**                                                    | **Key Technical Details to Study**                                                                             |

| **Concept & Usage**                         | Define template parts and their role in DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).            | Usage for global regions; distinction from reusable patterns (parts are structural, patterns are content).     |
| **[[parts/ structure]]**                    | File organization.                                                              | Located in `parts/` folder (e.g., `parts/header.html`); standardizing naming conventions.                      |
| **[[The wp:template-part Block]]**          | How to call a part within a template.                                           | `<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->`; usage of `tagName` for semantic HTML (HTML5).|
| **[[Areas Definition]]**                    | Registering parts in `theme.json`.                                              | Defining "area" (header, footer, general) in `theme.json` to categorize them in the Site Editor UI.            |
| **[[Semantic HTML wrappers]]**              | Accessibility and SEO implications.                                             | Using the `tagName` attribute to wrap the part in `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<aside>` automatically.          |
| **[[Variations]]**                          | Creating multiple headers/footers.                                              | `header-large.html`, `header-minimal.html`; user ability to swap parts in the editor.                          |
| **[[Classic Mapping]]**                     | Comparison with PHP includes.                                                   | Logic: `get_template_part('parts/header')` vs `wp:template-part {"slug":"header"}`.                           |
| **[[Editor visibility]]**                   | How users interact with parts.                                                  | Template Parts mode in Site Editor; isolated editing mode; replacing parts.                                    |
