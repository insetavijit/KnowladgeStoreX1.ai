| **FSE Overview**                       | Explain what Full Site Editing is and why it changes modern WordPress theming. | Shift from PHP templates to block-based templates; visual site building; Gutenberg evolution; block themes. |
| **[[What is Full Site Editing]]**      | Define FSE and contrast it with classic theming.                               | Site Editor vs Customizer; no header.php/footer.php; templates as blocks; visual editing of structure.      |
| **[[Block Themes vs Classic Themes]]** | Differentiate block themes and justify when to use each.                       | theme.json requirement; templates/parts folders; PHP fallback; compatibility; migration strategy.           |
| **[[Site Editor]]**                    | Demonstrate understanding of the FSE UI and its capabilities.                  | Appearance → Editor; editing templates, parts, styles; navigation block; WYSIWYG layout control.            |
| **[[Block-Based Templates]]**          | Explain how layouts are defined in FSE.                                        | HTML template files; block markup; template hierarchy in FSE; reusable patterns; fallback logic.            |
| **[[Template Parts]]**                 | Describe reusable structural components in FSE.                                | header.html, footer.html, sidebar parts; sync vs unsynced; global reuse across templates.                   |
| **[[Global Styles & theme.json]]**     | Show how design systems are defined in block themes.                           | settings vs styles; typography, colors, spacing; presets; CSS variables; user overrides.                    |
| **[[Patterns & Reusable Blocks]]**     | Explain layout reuse and rapid site building.                                  | Block patterns; pattern categories; synced patterns; starter layouts; pattern directory.                    |
| **[[Navigation in FSE]]**              | Explain how menus work in block themes.                                        | Navigation block; menu storage in blocks; no menu locations; responsive handling; fallback.                 |
| **[[Styling & CSS Handling]]**         | Describe how styling is generated and applied.                                 | Block supports; inline styles; style engine; CSS specificity; front-end vs editor parity.                   |
| **[[Extending FSE with Code]]**        | Show how developers customize beyond the UI.                                   | register_block_style; register_block_pattern; filters; PHP fallbacks; custom blocks; enqueue assets.        |
| **[[Backward Compatibility]]**         | Address coexistence with classic themes and plugins.                           | Hybrid themes; classic template fallback; plugin compatibility; disabling FSE features selectively.         |
| **[[Performance Considerations]]**     | Discuss performance impact of block-based theming.                             | Render cost; block parsing; cached templates; CSS size; avoiding excessive patterns.                        |
| **[[Common Pitfalls]]**                | Identify typical mistakes when adopting FSE.                                   | Overusing inline styles; ignoring theme.json; hard-coded patterns; poor hierarchy mapping; editor mismatch. |
| **[[When to Use FSE]]**                | Recommend FSE adoption based on project needs.                                 | Content-heavy sites; client editing needs; rapid theming; limits for complex logic; plugin readiness.       |
| **[[Role in Modern Theming]]**         | Position FSE in the future of WordPress themes.                                | WordPress roadmap; default themes; block-first ecosystem; long-term support direction.                      |
