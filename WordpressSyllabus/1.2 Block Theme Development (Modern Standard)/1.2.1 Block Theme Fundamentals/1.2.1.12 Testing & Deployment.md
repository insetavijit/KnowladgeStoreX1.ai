# 1.2.1.12 Testing & Deployment

**Overview**
**Testing & Deployment** is the final phase of the block theme lifecycle. Because block themes rely heavily on `theme.json` and client-side rendering style engines, testing involves verifying that styles load correctly across browsers and that the Site Editor experience is smooth for users. Deployment involves packaging the theme correctly (excluding dev files) and ensuring it meets the WordPress.org repository standards if public distribution is the goal.

| **Validation**                              | Ensuring code quality.                                                          | Using the **Theme Check** plugin validation; validating `theme.json` schema; W3C HTML validation.              |
| **[[Cross-Browser Testing]]**               | Style Engine consistency.                                                       | Checking CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts on Safari/Firefox; verify font loading performance; reduced motion settings. |
| **[[Responsiveness]]**                      | Mobile adaptation.                                                              | Testing fluid typography settings; navigation block behavior on mobile; column stacking order.                 |
| **[[User Experience Testing]]**             | Editor usability.                                                               | Can a user break the layout? Are template locks working? Do patterns insert correctly?                         |
| **[[Build Processes]]**                     | preparing for production.                                                       | `npm run build` (if using `@wordpress/scripts`); minifying CSS/JS; optimizing images.                          |
| **[[Packaging]]**                           | Creating the zip artifact.                                                      | Excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, source files (`src/`); ensuring strictly required files are present.         |
| **[[Repository Standards]]**                | Submitting to WP.org.                                                           | No PHP errors/warnings; unique slug; valid license URI; correct "Requires PHP" and "Requires WP" headers.      |
| **[[Visual Regression]]**                   | Advanced testing.                                                               | Using tools like Playwright to take screenshots of blocks and compare them against a baseline (optional/advanced).|
