# 1.2.1.10 Patterns & Style Variations

**Overview**
**Patterns** and **Style Variations** are the two primary ways to bundle design and layout in a block theme. Patterns are ready-to-insert sections of blocks (like a "Hero Section" or "Pricing Table"), while Style Variations are alternative global options (like a "Dark Mode" or "Vibrant Scheme") that users can switch between. Together, they allow a single theme to offer hundreds of different looks and layouts out of the box.

| **Section**                                 | **Interview Learning Goals**                                                    | **Key Technical Details to Study**                                                                             |

| **[[Block Patterns]]**                      | What are they?                                                                  | Pre-designed groups of blocks. Registered via PHP (classic) or simply placed in `patterns/` folder (modern).   |
| **[[Synced vs Standard]]**                  | Difference between Reusable Blocks (Synced) and Patterns (Standard).            | Synced: Updates everywhere when changed. Standard: Inserted as a copy, editable independently per instance.    |
| **[[Pattern Headers]]**                     | Identifying pattern files.                                                      | `Title: My Pattern`; `Slug: my-theme/my-pattern`; `Categories: header, footer`; `Keywords: ...`               |
| **[[Style Variations]]**                    | Creating alternate "skins" for the theme.                                       | Located in `styles/` folder as `.json` files; partial overrides of the main `theme.json`.                      |
| **[[Pattern Directory]]**                   | Leveraging the ecosystem.                                                       | Including patterns from the official WP Pattern Directory; theme-specific vs global patterns.                   |
| **[[Contextual Patterns]]**                 | Suggesting patterns intelligently.                                              | `Block Types: core/navigation`; showing relevant patterns when a user inserts a specific block.                |
| **[[Locking in Patterns]]**                 | Controlling user edits within patterns.                                         | `contentOnly` locking mode; allowing users to change text/images but not layout/structure.                     |
| **[[Styles Browsing]]**                     | How users interact with variations.                                             | "Browse Styles" in Site Editor; live previewing `styles/dark.json` vs `styles/light.json`.                     |
