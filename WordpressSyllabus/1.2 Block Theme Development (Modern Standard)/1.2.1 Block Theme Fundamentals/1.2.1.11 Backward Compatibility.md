# 1.2.1.11 Backward Compatibility

**Overview**
Transitioning to Block Themes doesn't happen overnight for the entire WordPress ecosystem. **Backward Compatibility** ensures that your block theme works gracefully with plugins that might still rely on classic hooks, and conversely, how to make "Hybrid" themes that use FSE features while keeping some PHP templates. It also covers how to prevent breaking sites when users switch from your classic theme to your new block theme.

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid Themes**                           | Bridging the gap.                                                               | adopting `theme.json` in a classic theme ("Universal Theme"); using block templates parts in PHP files.        |
| **[[Classic Features Support]]**            | What happens to Widgets and Menus?                                              | `add_theme_support('widgets')`; `register_nav_menus`; how FSE hides these screens by default.                  |
| **[[Script & Style Compatibility]]**        | Ensuring plugin assets load.                                                    | `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` are still mandatory (inside block templates via internal block logic).           |
| **[[Shortcodes]]**                          | Do they still work?                                                             | Yes, via the Shortcode block; legacy support for plugins not yet converted to blocks.                          |
| **[[Meta Boxes]]**                          | Handling classic custom fields.                                                 | "Custom Fields" toggle in Options; legacy meta box compatibility mode in the block editor.                     |
| **[[Upgrading Users]]**                     | Migration paths.                                                                | Preserving customizer settings (if applicable); mapping old menus to new Navigation blocks.                    |
| **[[Disabling FSE]]**                       | Can you turn it off?                                                            | Using `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` to keep the customizer but use blocks for content.             |
| **[[Feature Parity Check]]**                | Auditing capability.                                                            | Checking if `current_theme_supports('block-templates')` before running FSE logic.                              |
