# 1.2.1.6 Minimal functions.php

**Overview**
In a modern Block Theme, the `functions.php` file is significantly smaller than in classic themes. Since presentation logic (styles, templates, features) is now handled by `theme.json` and block markup, `functions.php` is strictly reserved for PHP-only logic. Its primary use cases are **enqueueing assets**, **registering patterns**, and **filtering core functionality**. It is no longer the dumping ground for theme setup.

| **Shift in Responsibility**                 | Why `functions.php` is "minimal" now.                                           | `add_theme_support` calls (logo, custom header) moved to `theme.json`; `wp_enqueue_scripts` reduced usage.     |
| **[[Enqueuing Assets]]**                    | How to load CSS/JS that isn't handled by blocks.                                | `wp_enqueue_style` for `style.css` (often optional); `wp_enqueue_script` for custom JS interactivity.          |
| **[[Pattern Registration]]**                | Registering block patterns via code (optional).                                 | `register_block_pattern` vs folder-based auto-registration (WP 6.0+ prefer folders).                           |
| **[[Custom Block Styles]]**                 | Using PHP to register variations.                                               | `register_block_style()`: Adding CSS classes to specific blocks (e.g., "Outline" style for buttons).           |
| **[[Theme Setup Action]]**                  | What still lives in `after_setup_theme`?                                        | Text domain loading (`load_theme_textdomain`); very few support flags not covered by JSON.                     |
| **[[Filters & Hooks]]**                     | Modifying core behavior.                                                        | `render_block` filter; `theme_json_extensions` filter (dynamic JSON modification).                             |
| **[[TGM Plugin Activation]]**               | Managing dependencies.                                                          | Recommending required plugins still happens here.                                                              |
| **[[Anti-Patterns]]**                       | What NOT to do in a block theme functions file.                                 | Avoid HTML generation; avoid presentation logic; disable widgets/menus (they are blocks now).                  |
