| **Block Patterns Overview**            | Explain what block patterns are and their role in WordPress.                   | Predefined block layouts, inserter integration, reusability; difference from reusable blocks.               |
| **[[What are Block Patterns]]**        | Define block patterns and their purpose.                                       | Pre-designed block combinations; layout templates; content creation acceleration.                           |
| **[[Patterns vs Reusable Blocks]]**    | Differentiate patterns from reusable blocks.                                   | Patterns = starting point (detached); Reusable blocks = synced instances; use cases for each.               |
| **[[Pattern Use Cases]]**              | Identify when to use patterns.                                                 | Hero sections, testimonials, pricing tables, team grids; repetitive layouts; starter content.               |
| **[[Pattern Inserter UI]]**            | Understand how users discover and insert patterns.                             | Block inserter, pattern tab, categories, search; preview functionality.                                      |
| **[[Built-in Patterns]]**              | Explore WordPress core patterns.                                               | Default patterns from WordPress; theme patterns; plugin patterns; pattern directory.                         |
| **[[Pattern Structure]]**              | Understand the anatomy of a pattern.                                           | Block markup (HTML comments), attributes, nested blocks; pattern metadata.                                   |
| **[[Pattern Registration]]**           | Learn how patterns are registered.                                             | `register_block_pattern()` function; PHP vs JSON registration; pattern properties.                          |
| **[[Pattern Properties]]**             | Understand pattern metadata fields.                                            | title, description, categories, keywords, viewportWidth, blockTypes; inserter visibility.                   |
| **[[Pattern Preview]]**                | Explain how pattern previews work.                                             | Viewport width setting; preview rendering; responsive preview; screenshot generation.                        |
| **[[Pattern Discovery]]**              | Describe how users find patterns.                                              | Search by keyword, filter by category, block-specific patterns; pattern directory integration.              |
