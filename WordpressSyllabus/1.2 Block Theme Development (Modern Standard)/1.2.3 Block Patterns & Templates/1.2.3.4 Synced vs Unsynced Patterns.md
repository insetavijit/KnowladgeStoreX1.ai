| **Synced vs Unsynced Patterns**       | Explain the difference between synced and unsynced patterns.                   | Reusable blocks (synced), regular patterns (unsynced); use cases; conversion between types.                |
| **[[Unsynced Patterns]]**              | Understand default pattern behavior.                                           | Patterns insert as independent blocks; edits don't affect other instances; starting point for customization.|
| **[[Synced Patterns]]**                | Understand reusable blocks (synced patterns).                                  | Single source of truth; edits propagate to all instances; wp_block post type; global updates.              |
| **[[Creating Synced Patterns]]**       | Convert blocks to reusable blocks.                                             | Select blocks → Create Reusable block; naming; saving; management.                                          |
| **[[Managing Reusable Blocks]]**       | Organize and edit synced patterns.                                             | Reusable blocks manager; editing the source; deleting; exporting/importing.                                |
| **[[Detaching Patterns]]**             | Convert synced patterns back to regular blocks.                                | Detach from reusable block; when to detach; one-time customization needs.                                  |
| **[[Pattern Updates]]**                | Understand update propagation.                                                 | Synced patterns update everywhere; unsynced patterns don't; version control considerations.                |
| **[[Use Cases for Synced]]**           | Identify when to use synced patterns.                                          | Site-wide elements (disclaimers, CTAs); consistent branding; centralized updates.                          |
| **[[Use Cases for Unsynced]]**         | Identify when to use unsynced patterns.                                        | Starting templates; one-off layouts; customizable sections; page-specific content.                         |
| **[[Conversion Between Types]]**       | Convert between synced and unsynced.                                           | Creating reusable from regular blocks; detaching reusable blocks; workflow flexibility.                    |
