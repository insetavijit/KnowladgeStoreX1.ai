**Overview**  
Featured images (post thumbnails) and custom image sizes are the visual foundation of any theme. By enabling `post-thumbnails` support and defining specialized dimensions, themes ensure that media is both beautiful and optimized for performance. In the era of high-density displays (Retina) and mobile-first design, mastering responsive image handling with `srcset` and `sizes` is critical. A professional developer must understand how to balance the need for high-quality visuals with the imperative of fast page loads, while also considering accessibility and SEO through proper metadata and attribute management.

| **[[Responsive Images: srcset]]**        | Explain how WordPress handles high-DPI and mobile resolutions.        | Automatic `srcset` generation; multi-resolution support; delivery based on viewport size.       |
| **[[Filter: max_srcset_image_width]]**   | Describe limiting the maximum width for generated srcsets.            | Performance optimization; preventing extremely large 5k images from being included in markup.   |
| **[[Image Alt Text & SEO]]**             | Discuss retrieving and displaying attachment metadata for images.      | `get_post_meta( $id, '_wp_attachment_image_alt', true )`; accessibility requirements.         |
| **[[WP Media Regenerate]]**              | Explain handling existing images after adding new sizes.               | Re-processing old media; using WP-CLI or plugins like "Regenerate Thumbnails".                 |

| **[[set_post_thumbnail_size()]]**        | Describe setting the default featured image dimension.                | One-call setup for the primary theme image; usually maps to the 'post-thumbnail' size.          |
| **[[Removing Theme Support]]**           | Explain disabling featured images in specific contexts.                | `remove_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' )`; child theme overrides or plugin cleanup.          |
| **[[Image Performance: Lazy Loading]]**  | Discuss the automatic `loading="lazy"` attribute in WordPress.         | Speed optimization; browser-level lazy loading; impact on LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).       |
| **[[REST API Image Exposure]]**          | Explain accessing featured images in headless WordPress.              | `_embedded` data; `featured_media` ID; querying attachment endpoints for URLs and sizes.       |
