**Overview**  
Theme customization options provide a user-friendly bridge between high-level design choices and complex theme logic. Through the WordPress Customizer API, developers can expose settings—like accent colors, typography, or layout toggles—with a live preview that simplifies the editing experience. A professional theme developer must master the nuances of settings, sections, and controls, understand the performance benefits of selective refresh, and ensure that all user inputs are rigorously sanitized. As WordPress evolves, balancing the classic Customizer with modern `theme.json` styling is essential for building flexible, modern themes.

| **[[Customizer Concept]]**               | Explain the role of the Customizer in modern WordPress.                | Visual editing; live preview; standardizing theme options; native core API.                    |
| **[[customize_register Hook]]**          | Identify the action and callback for registering settings.             | `add_action( 'customize_register', 'my_callback' )`; receiving the `$wp_customize` manager object.|
| **[[Setting vs Control]]**               | Differentiate between data storage and the UI interface.              | **Setting**: Database record; **Control**: The HTML input in the dashboard sidebar.            |
| **[[$wp_customize->add_setting()]]**     | Explain registering a new data point.                                 | Defining IDs; defaults; sanitization callbacks; transport types (refresh/postMessage).         |
| **[[Sanitization Callbacks]]**           | Describe why every setting must have a specific cleanup function.      | `sanitize_hex_color()`, `absint()`, `esc_url()`; ensuring safe data persistence.               |
| **[[Transport: refresh]]**               | Explain the default behavior of reloading the preview window.         | Browser refresh on change; simple implementation; performance trade-off for complex themes.    |
| **[[Transport: postMessage]]**           | Describe the advanced method for instant, JS-based previewing.        | Real-time CSS updates via JS; requiring separate script enqueuing in `customize-preview.js`.   |
| **[[Selective Refresh]]**                | Explain partial rendering of theme components for better UX.          | `WP_Customize_Manager->selective_refresh`; targetting specific IDs; avoiding full-page reloads. |
| **[[Sections & Panels]]**                 | Describe the organizational hierarchy of the Customizer UI.           | Grouping related controls into sections; grouping sections into panels for complex themes.     |
| **[[$wp_customize->add_control()]]**     | Identify adding standard UI components like text or checkboxes.       | Setting labels, descriptions, and section mapping; basic HTML5 input type support.             |
| **[[Advanced Control Classes]]**         | Describe using specialized UI like Color or Image pickers.            | `WP_Customize_Color_Control`, `WP_Customize_Image_Control`; consistent core UI.                |
| **[[Custom Control Classes]]**           | Discuss building a bespoke UI component (e.g., a range slider).       | Subclassing `WP_Customize_Control`; implementing `render_content()`; bespoke JS/CSS.           |
| **[[Theme Mods API]]**                   | Explain how Customizer data is retrieved and stored.                  | `get_theme_mod( $id, $default )`; database format; theme-specific storage.                     |
| **[[Options API in Customizer]]**        | Describe using global site options instead of theme-specific mods.    | `'type' => 'option'` in `add_setting`; site-wide settings (e.g., social links).                |
| **[[Live Preview JavaScript]]**          | Identify the API and script for real-time CSS injection.              | `wp.customize( 'id', function( value ) { ... } )`; manipulating the DOM in the preview window. |
| **[[Access Controls: Capability]]**      | Explain restricting customizer options by user role.                  | The `capability` parameter in `add_setting`; default 'edit_theme_options'.                     |
| **[[Active Callbacks]]**                 | Describe conditionally showing controls based on other settings.      | `active_callback` parameter; logical checks (e.g., only show color if 'Enable Color' is true). |
| **[[Priority Handling]]**                | Explain controlling the visual order of sections and items.           | `priority` parameter; integer sorting; organizing the dashboard for better UX.                 |
| **[[Customizer vs theme.json]]**         | Discuss the transition from the Customizer to Global Styles.          | The "Appearance" menu shift in FSE themes; the future of style management in WordPress.       |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the gold standard for customizer development.               | Prefix all IDs; use selective refresh; strict sanitization; offer sensible defaults.           |
