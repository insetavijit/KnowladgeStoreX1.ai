**Overview**  
Child themes are the safest and most effective way to customize an existing WordPress theme. By decoupling your modifications from the parent theme's core files, you ensure that parental updates can occur without overwriting your custom CSS or logic. Mastering child themes requires a deep understanding of WordPress's file inheritance system, the critical order in which `functions.php` files are loaded, and the techniques for selectively overriding template parts while maintaining parent theme dependencies. A professional developer uses child themes not just for styling, but for fundamentally altering theme behavior while preserving a maintainable and secure codebase.

| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Child Theme Philosophy]]**           | Explain why child themes are mandatory for customization.              | Preserving updates; modularity; separating core logic from design tweaks.                       |
| **[[style.css Requirements]]**           | Identify the specific header fields that activate inheritance.        | `Theme Name`; `Template` (the folder name of the parent theme); `Author`.                       |
| **[[File System Structure]]**            | Describe the minimal directory layout for a child theme.              | A separate folder in `wp-content/themes/`; containing at least `style.css`.                    |
| **[[Parent vs Child Search Path]]**      | Explain how WordPress searches for template files.                    | Child theme folder checked first; parent theme folder as the immediate fallback.                |
| **[[Overriding Templates]]**             | Identify which files can be overridden by simply copying them.        | `index.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `sidebar.php`; direct file-for-file replacement.      |
| **[[Selective Part Overrides]]**         | Explain overriding sub-directories (e.g., `template-parts`).          | Matching paths in the child theme; `get_template_part()` behavior in inheritance.              |
| **[[functions.php Loading Order]]**      | Describe the critical execution sequence of parent/child functions.   | **Child** file loads first; **Parent** file loads second; implications for pluggable functions. |
| **[[Pluggable Functions]]**              | Explain using `if ( ! function_exists() )` in parent themes.          | Allowing child themes to define a function first to prevent the parent version from loading.    |
| **[[Enqueuing Parent Styles]]**          | Describe the modern way to load parent CSS.                           | Using `wp_enqueue_style`; linking to the parent directory via `get_template_directory_uri()`.  |
| **[[Styles Dependency Management]]**     | Explain ensuring the child style loads AFTER the parent style.        | Using the `$deps` array in `wp_enqueue_style` to order the CSS queue correctly.                |
| **[[get_stylesheet_directory_uri()]]**   | Explain the difference between stylesheet and template URIs.          | **Stylesheet** refers to the active (child) theme; **Template** refers to the parent theme.     |
| **[[Overriding PHP Logic]]**             | Discuss strategies to modify parent logic in `functions.php`.         | Using `remove_action()` and `remove_filter()` on parent hooks; adding new hooks with priority. |
| **[[Child Theme Screenshot]]**           | Describe the role of `screenshot.png` in the child folder.            | Visual identification in the dashboard; dimensions and file format best practices.               |
| **[[Template Variable Overrides]]**      | Explain the limitations of overriding variables in parent files.       | Variable scope; why filters/hooks are better than direct file overrides for logic changes.      |
| **[[i18n: load_child_theme_textdomain()]]**| Describe implementing multi-language support in child themes.       | Registering the domain; loading `.mo` files from the child theme's `/languages` folder.        |
| **[[JavaScript in Child Themes]]**       | Describe adding or replacing scripts in a child theme.                | `wp_dequeue_script` for parent scripts; registering custom assets for child functionality.      |
| **[[Child Theme Configuration (JSON)]]** | Discuss using `theme.json` in child themes for block support.         | Merging JSON settings; overriding parent theme block styles and color palettes.                |
| **[[Custom Template Files]]**            | Describe creating entirely new templates in a child theme.           | Adding `page-custom.php`; specific templates that don't exist in the parent theme.             |
| **[[Common Pitfalls]]**                  | Identify frequent errors like typos in the 'Template' header.         | Broken parent relationship; 404s on CSS; infinite loops from incorrect enqueuing.              |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the gold standard for child theme maintenance.             | Keep overrides minimal; use hooks wherever possible; document parent theme version compatibility. |
