**Overview**  
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in WordPress is the system that determines what specific users can see and do within your theme. While authentication identifies *who* a user is, RBAC handles *what* they are allowed to access (authorization). WordPress implements this through a system of Roles (predefined groups) and Capabilities (granular permissions). A professional theme developer must move beyond simple "is admin" checks and utilize capability-based logic to ensure that contributors, editors, and authors have the exact permissions required for their tasks without compromising site security. Mastering RBAC ensures that your theme remains secure, usable, and respects the hierarchy of site management.

| **[[Authorization Concept]]**            | Explain the difference between authentication and authorization.      | Identity (AuthN) vs Permissions (AuthZ); why both are required for security.                    |
| **[[Default WP Roles]]**                 | Identify the standard roles and their general purposes.               | Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber; Super Admin (Multisite).                |
| **[[Capabilities System]]**              | Describe granular permissions (e.g., `edit_posts`).                    | Over 50 core capabilities; mapping actions to specific permission tags.                        |
| **[[current_user_can()]]**               | Identify the primary function for capability checks.                  | The "Golden Rule" of authorization; checking permission before any sensitive code execution.   |
| **[[Least Privilege Principle]]**        | Explain why checking capabilities is better than checking roles.       | Flexibility; allowing custom roles; avoiding 'hard-coded' role dependency; future-proofing.    |
| **[[Check by Post ID]]**                 | Describe verifying if a user can edit a specific post.                | `current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post_id )`; map_meta_cap; handling ownership logic.           |
| **[[Custom Capabilities]]**              | Explain defining new permissions for your theme.                      | Adding unique tags for theme features; registering capabilities for Custom Post Types.          |
| **[[Role & Capability Storage]]**        | Describe how permissions are stored in the database.                  | Formatted serialize data in `wp_options`; shared across the site.                              |
| **[[Modifying Roles: add_cap()]]**       | Describe adding a permission to an existing role.                     | `WP_Role` object; persistence in DB; implementation once (usually on theme/plugin activation).|
| **[[Removing Roles: remove_cap()]]**     | Explain stripping permissions from a role.                            | Tightening security; removing unwanted defaults; customizing user workflows.                  |
| **[[Creating Custom Roles]]**            | Describe `add_role()` for bespoke user types.                         | Defining a new group matching specific business needs (e.g., "Premium Member", "Store Manager").|
| **[[User Meta Capabilities]]**           | Explain how individual users can have unique permissions.             | The `wp_capabilities` user meta; overrides; individual-level access control.                   |
| **[[map_meta_cap Filter]]**              | Describe advanced context-aware permission mapping.                   | Converting meta-capabilities (like `edit_post`) into primitive ones based on logic.           |
| **[[Multisite Permissions]]**            | Explain the `is_super_admin()` check.                                 | Network-level vs Site-level access; protecting network settings in a multi-tenant setup.       |
| **[[Protecting Admin Pages]]**           | Describe using `current_user_can` in `add_menu_page`.                 | Restricting dashboard access; ensuring menu items only show to authorized users.               |
| **[[REST API Authorization]]**           | Explain securing endpoints based on capabilities.                      | `permission_callback` in REST routes; ensuring data isn't leaked via the JSON API.            |
| **[[Front-end Content Masking]]**        | Describe conditional display based on permissions.                    | Showing "Edit" links only to authors; hiding premium content from subscribers.                 |
| **[[Plugins for RBAC]]**                 | Identify tools for managing roles visually.                           | User Role Editor; Members plugin; why developers should understand the code behind them.       |
| **[[Security Risks of Over-Privilege]]** | Discuss the dangers of giving too much access.                        | Accidental deletion; malware injection (XSS/RCE); compromised site integrity.                  |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the professional standard for permission management.         | Check capabilities, not roles; use specific caps; respect ownership; document custom roles.    |
