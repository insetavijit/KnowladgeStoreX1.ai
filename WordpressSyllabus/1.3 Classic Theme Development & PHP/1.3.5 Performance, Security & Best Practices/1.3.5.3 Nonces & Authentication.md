**Overview**  
Nonces (numbers used once) and authentication are critical for protecting WordPress from request-based attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). A nonce is a cryptographic token generated by WordPress to verify that a request was intentioned by a specific user from a specific location (the admin dashboard). Authentication ensures that the person making the request has a valid session and is who they claim to be. Together, they form a defensive wall that prevents attackers from tricking administrators into performing destructive actions. Mastering nonces is essential for securing form submissions, AJAX requests, and custom links in any professional WordPress theme.

| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Nonce Concept]]**                    | Explain what a nonce is and why it's used.                          | CSRF protection; one-time tokens (technically time-limited); intent verification.               |
| **[[wp_create_nonce()]]**                | Describe creating a raw nonce token.                                  | Generating a string based on action name, user ID, and time; secret key dependency.             |
| **[[wp_nonce_field()]]**                 | Explain adding a nonce to an HTML form.                               | Generates two hidden inputs (token and referrer); the easiest way to secure classic forms.      |
| **[[wp_nonce_url()]]**                   | Describe securing GET requests in links.                              | Appending `_wpnonce=...` to a URL; securing delete/archive links; referrer safety.             |
| **[[wp_verify_nonce()]]**                | Explain verifying a nonce on the server side.                         | Checking the token against the action; returns 1 (fresh), 2 (old), or false (invalid).          |
| **[[check_admin_referer()]]**            | Describe high-level verification for admin requests.                  | Verifies nonce and referrer; `wp_die()` on failure; standard for admin form processing.        |
| **[[check_ajax_referer()]]**             | Explain securing AJAX requests.                                       | Verifies nonce specifically for AJAX; handles error responses; essential for dynamic themes.    |
| **[[Nonce Expiration & Tick]]**          | Describe the lifespan of a WordPress nonce.                           | 24 hours by default (two 12-hour ticks); `nonce_life` filter; security vs usability.            |
| **[[Nonce Salt Dependency]]**            | Explain why security keys in `wp-config.php` are vital for nonces.    | Nonces are hashed with salts; if salts are public, nonces can be forged; key rotation.          |
| **[[Action-Specific Nonces]]**           | Describe why unique action names are necessary.                       | Preventing "replay" attacks; ensuring a token for 'delete' can't be used for 'update'.          |
| **[[Securing AJAX with Nonces]]**        | Identify the workflow for frontend-to-backend verification.           | Localizing scripts with nonce; sending in data object; verifying in the PHP handler.           |
| **[[The Referrer Check]]**               | Explain the role of the `_wp_http_referer`.                           | Ensuring the request originated from the same server; secondary check in admin functions.       |
| **[[Authentication Cookies]]**           | Describe how WordPress tracks logged-in users.                        | Secure vs non-secure cookies; `logged_in` cookie; hashing process; expiration.                 |
| **[[is_user_logged_in()]]**              | Identify the primary check for authenticated users.                    | Core function for conditional display/access based on login status; frontend protection.       |
| **[[wp_set_current_user()]]**            | Explain programmatically authenticating a user.                       | Session management; user object population; used in custom login/auth flows.                   |
| **[[Session Management]]**               | Describe how WordPress handles multiple logins.                        | Session tokens; destroying all sessions; user profile 'log out everywhere' feature.            |
| **[[CSRF Attack Pattern]]**              | Define the vulnerability nonces are designed to stop.                 | Cross-Site Request Forgery; tricking users into clicking harmful links; impact on admin.       |
| **[[Nonces and Caching]]**               | Discuss the conflict between static caching and nonces.               | Nonces change over time; challenges with page caching; AJAX-loading nonces as a solution.      |
| **[[When to Use Nonces]]**               | Identify scenarios requiring nonce protection.                        | Any action that modifies data (save, delete, update); sensitive info disclosure; settings.     |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the professional standard for request safety.               | Always verify; use specific actions; handle failures gracefully; never trust a URL alone.      |
