**Overview**  
Testing and debugging are the verification processes that ensure a theme works as intended and remains error-free throughout its lifecycle. Debugging involves identifying and resolving bugs using tools like `WP_DEBUG`, Query Monitor, and Browser DevTools, while testing involves programmatically or manually verifying that individual components (unit testing) or the entire system (integration testing) behave correctly. For a professional developer, a bug-free theme is a matter of process, not luck. By implementing a robust verification strategy, you can catch errors before they reach production, optimize performance hotspots, and ensure a seamless experience for site administrators and visitors alike.

| **[[The Debugging Mindset]]**            | Explain the process of isolating and resolving a bug.                 | Reproduction steps; identifying symptoms vs causes; incremental testing.                        |
| **[[WP_DEBUG & Friends]]**               | Identify core WordPress debugging constants.                          | `WP_DEBUG`, `WP_DEBUG_LOG`, `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY`, `SCRIPT_DEBUG`; identifying hidden errors.      |
| **[[Error Logging]]**                    | Describe how to read and use `debug.log`.                             | Locating the log; interpreting stack traces; logging custom data with `error_log()`.           |
| **[[Query Monitor]]**                    | Describe the most powerful plugin for theme debugging.                | Tracking DB queries, PHP errors, hooks, and scripts in the admin bar; locating bottlenecks.    |
| **[[Browser DevTools]]**                 | Explain debugging frontend issues (CSS/JS).                            | Inspecting elements; the Console; Network tab for asset timing; JS breakpoints.                |
| **[[Debugging AJAX]]**                   | Describe identifying failures in background requests.                  | Using Network tab; logging PHP responses; handling JSON errors in the browser.                 |
| **[[WP-CLI for Debugging]]**             | Explain using the command line for verification.                       | `wp eval`; checking core integrity; managing users/settings during troubleshooting.             |
| **[[Unit Testing with PHPUnit]]**        | Describe testing small, isolated logic components.                     | Writing test cases for theme functions; mocking dependencies; automated verification.          |
| **[[Integration Testing]]**              | Explain testing how different WP components work together.             | Verifying that theme settings interact correctly with core blocks or CPTs.                     |
| **[[Visual Regression Testing]]**        | Describe automated detection of UI changes.                            | Tools like BackstopJS; comparing screenshots of the theme before/after code changes.           |
| **[[Manual Review Checklists]]**         | Identify critical human verification steps.                            | Cross-browser testing; mobile responsiveness; checking accessibility with a keyboard.          |
| **[[Testing with Large Data]]**          | Describe stress-testing a theme with thousands of items.              | Using the WordPress Theme Unit Test Data; checking pagination and query performance.           |
| **[[Debugging Mobile Issues]]**          | Explain using device emulation and remote debugging.                  | Inspecting themes on real or simulated mobile devices; identifying touch/responsive bugs.      |
| **[[Environment Parity]]**               | Describe the importance of local vs staging vs production.             | Ensuring the dev environment matches the server; preventing "works on my machine" issues.       |
| **[[Profile & Trace Tools]]**            | Identify Xdebug and profiling tools.                                  | Advanced PHP debugging; step-through execution; analyzing call stacks and memory usage.        |
| **[[Automated CI Testing]]**             | Explain running tests in GitHub Actions on every push.                | Catching breaking changes early; ensuring a standard of reliability in the repository.        |
| **[[Plugin Conflict Testing]]**          | Describe isolating theme bugs from plugin interference.                | Deactivating plugins; switching to a default theme; identifying the source of an error.        |
| **[[Catching Undefined Notices]]**       | Explain why notices are just as important as fatal errors.             | Preventing unexpected behavior; identifying future-proofing issues; ensuring clean logs.       |
| **[[Handling Edge Cases]]**              | Identify scenarios often missed (empty results, long titles).          | Testing the "unhappy path"; ensuring design doesn't break under extreme content scenarios.     |
