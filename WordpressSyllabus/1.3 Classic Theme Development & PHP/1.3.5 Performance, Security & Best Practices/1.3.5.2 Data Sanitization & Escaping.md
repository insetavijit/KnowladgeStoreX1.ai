**Overview**  
Data sanitization and escaping are the two most fundamental defenses in a theme developer's toolkit. Sanitization ensures that data entering your database is "clean" and free of malicious or unexpected characters, while escaping ensures that data displayed to the user is safe and cannot be executed as malicious code (preventing XSS). Following the rule of "Sanitize Early, Escape Late" is critical for theme security. WordPress provides a robust suite of helper functions for every context—be it text fields, URLs, HTML attributes, or database queries. Mastering these functions ensures that your theme remains a secure environment for user interactions and data management.

| **[[The Security Golden Rule]]**         | Explain "Sanitize Early, Escape Late".                               | Cleaning on input; protecting on output; why late escaping is more flexible and secure.         |
| **[[Sanitization vs Validation]]**       | Differentiate between cleaning data and checking its form.            | Sanitizing (stripping tags); Validating (ensuring it's an email/date); order of operations.     |
| **[[sanitize_text_field()]]**            | Describe the most common sanitization helper.                         | Strips HTML, line breaks, and extra whitespace; ideal for name/title inputs.                   |
| **[[sanitize_textarea_field()]]**        | Explain sanitizing multi-line inputs.                                 | Preserves line breaks but strips tags; safe for bio/description fields.                      |
| **[[sanitize_key()]]**                   | Describe cleaning slugs and identifiers.                              | Lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores; used for meta keys and option names.         |
| **[[sanitize_email()]]**                 | Explain specialized email cleaning.                                   | Removing invalid chars while preserving email structure; ensuring delivery safety.              |
| **[[absint() & intval()]]**              | Describe sanitizing numeric data.                                     | Converting input to integers; `absint()` for non-negative numbers; protecting IDs.              |
| **[[esc_html()]]**                       | Explain the primary output escape for text.                           | Converts `< > & " '` to entities; used inside HTML tags (e.g., `<div>...</div>`).              |
| **[[esc_attr()]]**                       | Describe escaping for HTML attributes.                                | Safe for `value="..."` or `title="..."`; preventing attribute breakout.                        |
| **[[esc_url()]]**                        | Explain securing links and resources.                                 | Cleaning URLs; checking protocols; preventing `javascript:` pseudo-protocols.                  |
| **[[esc_url_raw()]]**                    | Differentiate between display URLs and database URLs.                 | Safe for DB storage or redirects; doesn't convert `&` to `&amp;`; API usage.                   |
| **[[wp_kses() & variants]]**             | Describe selective HTML escaping.                                     | `wp_kses_post()`; allowed tags/attributes; flexible filtering for rich text output.            |
| **[[esc_js()]]**                         | Explain escaping for inline JavaScript.                               | Protecting data inside `<script>` or `onclick` handlers; preventing script injection.          |
| **[[json_encode() for Data]]**           | Describe safe way to pass data to JS.                                 | Converting PHP arrays to safe JS objects; avoiding manual string building in scripts.           |
| **[[Context-Aware Escaping]]**           | Explain why choosing the right escape function is vital.              | `esc_html` in `esc_attr` issues; breakout prevention; matching the output location.            |
| **[[Sanitizing File Names]]**            | Describe `sanitize_file_name()`.                                      | Removing paths and dangerous chars from uploads; preventing directory traversal.              |
| **[[Custom Sanitization Filters]]**      | Explain using regex for bespoke data types.                           | `preg_replace` for custom formats; when core functions aren't specific enough.                 |
| **[[The Threat of XSS]]**                | Define Cross-Site Scripting in the theme context.                     | Malicious script execution; session theft; defacement; why escaping is the antidote.           |
| **[[Manual vs Automatic Escaping]]**     | Discuss why WordPress doesn't escape everything automatically.         | Performance; developer control; flexibility; why the burden is on the theme author.            |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the professional standard for data safety.                  | Always sanitize; always escape; use the most specific function; never trust user input.        |
