**Overview**  
Asset optimization is the process of minimizing the weight and delivery time of the frontend files—CSS, JavaScript, and images—that constitute a WordPress theme. Since these files are downloaded by every visitor, their optimization directly impacts the perceived speed and usability of a site. This involves using modern delivery techniques like async and defer, implementing smart enqueuing strategies to avoid loading unused code, and utilizing tools for minification and concatenation. In a mobile-first world, fine-tuning asset delivery ensures that themes load efficiently even on constrained networks, leading to better search rankings and higher user retention.

| **[[Frontend Optimization Basics]]**     | Explain the impact of assets on page load.                            | Payload size; HTTP request count; render-blocking resources.                                   |
| **[[Conditional Enqueuing]]**            | Describe loading scripts only on relevant pages.                      | Using `is_page()`, `is_single()`, or `has_shortcode()` inside the enqueue hook.                |
| **[[Selective Enqueuing]]**              | Explain deregistering parent/plugin scripts.                           | `wp_deregister_script()`; `wp_dequeue_style()`; removing unused bloat in child themes.         |
| **[[Asset Minification]]**               | Describe stripping whitespace and comments for production.              | Tools like Terser, cssnano; reducing file size without changing logic.                          |
| **[[Asset Concatenation]]**              | Explain merging many files into one.                                  | Reducing HTTP requests; caveats for HTTP/2 multiplexing environments.                          |
| **[[The wp_enqueue Functions]]**         | Identify the safe way to load assets in WordPress.                     | `wp_enqueue_script()`; `wp_enqueue_style()`; using dependency and version parameters.          |
| **[[Async & Defer Attributes]]**         | Describe non-blocking JavaScript delivery.                             | `async` vs `defer`; using the `script_loader_tag` filter to inject attributes.                 |
| **[[Loading Scripts in Footer]]**        | Explain moving non-critical scripts to the bottom of the page.         | The `$in_footer` parameter; improving initial rendering speed.                                 |
| **[[CSS Delivery Strategies]]**          | Describe inlining critical CSS and deferring the rest.                | Bypassing the render-blocking nature of standard stylesheets for key UI elements.              |
| **[[Resource Hints]]**                   | Explain `preload`, `prefetch`, and `preconnect`.                      | Giving the browser early warnings about critical font, image, or JS assets.                   |
| **[[Handling External Assets]]**         | Describe safely enqueuing CDNs and external libraries.                | Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes; caching local fallbacks; latency considerations.           |
| **[[WordPress Default Scripts]]**        | Identify built-in libraries (jQuery, Underscore).                      | Avoiding redundant library loads; using core versions to ensure compatibility.                |
| **[[Asset Versioning]]**                 | Explain using file versions to bust caches.                            | Using `filemtime()` or Git hashes in the version parameter for instant updates on change.      |
| **[[HTTP/2 Multiplexing]]**              | Discuss how modern server tech changes asset strategy.                 | Why smaller, modular files can be faster than massive concatenated bundles in HTTP/2.          |
| **[[Optimized File Local Loading]]**     | Describe hosting assets locally vs on CDNs.                           | Privacy (GDPR); connection overhead; reliability; browser caching strategies.                  |
| **[[Critical Asset Auditing]]**          | Identify tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.                        | Analyzing unused CSS/JS; identifying large payloads; measurable performance improvements.     |
| **[[Image Optimization in Themes]]**     | Describe the role of `add_image_size` in asset weight.                | Preventing oversized image downloads; matching dimensions to container widths.                 |
| **[[Handling Icon Fonts]]**              | Compare icon fonts (FontAwesome) vs inline SVGs.                      | Performance cost; rendering bloat; why SVGs are often the modern choice for speed.             |
| **[[The block.json Asset Pattern]]**     | Describe modern asset management in WordPress blocks.                  | Enqueuing only when a specific block is present on the page; maximum efficiency.               |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the gold standard for asset delivery.                       | Enqueue conditionally; use async/defer; minify; version your files; audit regularly.           |
