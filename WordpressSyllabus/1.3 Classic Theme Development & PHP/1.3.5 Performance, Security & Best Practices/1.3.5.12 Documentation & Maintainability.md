**Overview**  
Documentation and maintainability are the long-term commitments that ensure a theme remains useful and healthy long after its initial release. For a theme developer, "code is meant to be read by humans and only accidentally executed by computers." This involves using PHPDoc to describe functions and classes, maintaining clear changelogs to track evolution, and providing user-facing README files for configuration. A maintainable theme is modular, follows consistent patterns, and is easy for another developer—or your future self—to understand and extend. Investing in documentation is investment in the project's sustainability, reducing support calls and making future upgrades straightforward.

| **[[The Documentation Mindset]]**        | Explain why writing about code is as important as writing code.       | Knowledge transfer; reducing technical debt; facilitating collaboration; ease of maintenance.  |
| **[[PHPDoc Fundamentals]]**              | Describe documenting individual PHP components correctly.              | Blocks for variables, functions, and classes; required tags; standardized formatting.          |
| **[[Function Headers]]**                 | Identify the `@param`, `@return`, and `@since` tags.                  | Explaining arguments, expected output, and which version introduced the feature.                |
| **[[Inline Comments]]**                  | Explain describing the "why" and "how" of complex logic.              | Clarifying intent; documenting workarounds or "hacks"; keeping logic understandable.            |
| **[[The README.txt/md File]]**           | Identify the standard WordPress project manifest.                      | Description, installation instructions, requirements, license, and changelog.                   |
| **[[Changelog Management]]**             | Describe tracking changes between theme versions.                      | Documenting fixes, features, and breaking changes for users and developers.                    |
| **[[Self-Documenting Code]]**            | Explain using descriptive names to reduce the need for comments.       | Clean code principles; naming variables/functions so their purpose is obvious at a glance.      |
| **[[Modular Architecture]]**             | Describe breaking large files into smaller, logical components.        | Using `inc/` or `classes/` folders; separation of concerns; improving code navigability.        |
| **[[Version Control Flow]]**             | Discuss using Git for project history and collaboration.               | Branching strategies; meaningful commit messages; tracking the evolution of a feature.          |
| **[[Deprecation Strategy]]**             | Explain how to phase out old code without breaking sites.              | Using `_deprecated_function()`; providing migration paths; giving users time to adapt.         |
| **[[Hook Documentation]]**               | Describe documenting custom actions and filters in your theme.         | Allowing other developers/plugins to safely extend your theme's behavior.                      |
| **[[Theme Header Metadata]]**            | Identify the required fields in `style.css`.                           | Version, Theme URI, Author, License; ensuring the theme is correctly identified by core.       |
| **[[User Support Documentation]]**       | Describe providing setup guides for non-technical administrators.      | Explaining customizer settings, widget areas, and CPT usage in plain language.                 |
| **[[Code Complexity Metrics]]**          | Discuss keeping logic simple and avoids "deep nesting".               | Cyclomatic complexity; making functions single-purpose; improving testability.                 |
| **[[Standardizing File Structure]]**     | Explain using predictable folder layouts (assets, inc, parts).         | Reducing the "onboarding" time for new developers on the project.                              |
| **[[Software Licensing]]**               | Describe the GPL and its impact on WordPress themes.                   | Understanding open-source rights and responsibilities; including the LICENSE file.             |
| **[[Refactoring Best Practices]]**       | Explain the process of cleaning up legacy code safely.                 | Identifying "code smells"; incremental improvement; verifying with tests after refactoring.     |
| **[[Documentation Generators]]**         | Identify tools like phpDocumentor or Doxygen.                         | Automated generation of visual API docs from your PHPDoc comments.                             |
| **[[Future-Proofing Logic]]**            | Describe writing code that anticipates WordPress updates.              | Avoiding private/internal APIs; following public standards; using stable core wrapper functions.|
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the gold standard for theme sustainability.                 | Document as you go; follow PHPDoc; use READMEs; keep it modular; code for the next developer.   |
