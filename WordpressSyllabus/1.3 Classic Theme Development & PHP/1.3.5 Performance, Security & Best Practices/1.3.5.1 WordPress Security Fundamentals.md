**Overview**  
WordPress security is a multi-layered approach that starts with understanding the core protection mechanisms provided by the platform. From secure password hashing and user role management to file system permissions and automatic updates, WordPress core is designed with security in mind. However, theme developers must bridge the gap by correctly implementing security APIs, respecting the principle of least privilege, and understanding how WordPress handles authentication and authorization. Mastering these fundamentals is the first step toward building resilient themes that protect both user data and server infrastructure.

| **[[WordPress Core Security]]**          | Describe how WordPress core stays secure.                             | Security team; automatic updates; security patches; bug bounty programs; hardening.             |
| **[[File Permissions]]**                 | Identify safe file and folder permissions.                            | 644 for files; 755 for directories; `wp-config.php` protection; folder harding.               |
| **[[The wp-config.php File]]**           | Explain securing the most sensitive file.                             | Security keys (salts); moving the file; disabling editing; database prefix customization.       |
| **[[User Role Fundamentals]]**           | Describe the default WordPress role hierarchy.                         | Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber; least privilege principle.              |
| **[[Capabilities vs Roles]]**            | Differentiate between what a user *is* and what they can *do*.        | Role-based vs Capability-based checks; mapping roles to permission sets.                       |
| **[[Authentication Lifecycle]]**         | Explain how WordPress identifies users.                               | Cookies; sessions; password hashing (`wp_hash_password`); login process security.               |
| **[[Salt & Security Keys]]**             | Describe the role of salts in secret management.                      | `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, etc.; adding entropy to hashes; rotation best practices.       |
| **[[SSL/HTTPS in WordPress]]**           | Explain the importance of encrypted communication.                    | `force_ssl_admin`; secure cookies; mixed content issues; transition to HTTPS.                 |
| **[[Login Security]]**                   | Identify techniques to protect the login screen.                      | Login limits (via plugins); 2FA; XML-RPC disabling; protecting `wp-login.php`.                 |
| **[[Securing REST API]]**                | Describe basic security for the JSON API.                             | Authentication headers; nonces; identifying endpoints; restricting public access.              |
| **[[Vulnerability Scanning]]**           | Explain identifying common weaknesses.                                | WPScan; online scanners; identifying outdated components; security audits.                     |
| **[[Principle of Least Privilege]]**     | Discuss implementing minimal access in themes.                        | Only giving code/users the permissions they absolutely need; avoiding 'admin' overkill.         |
| **[[Security Through Obscurity]]**       | Explain why hiding info isn't enough (but can help).                  | Changing slugs; hiding version numbers; why it's a secondary defense, not primary.             |
| **[[Handling Security Reports]]**        | Describe the ethical way to report vulnerabilities.                   | Responsible disclosure; contacting developers; security teams; timelines for fixes.            |
| **[[Global Security Constants]]**        | Identify constants that harden WordPress.                              | `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT`, `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS`, `WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL`.                          |
| **[[Database Security Basics]]**         | Explain basic DB hardening for themes.                                | Table prefixes; avoiding raw queries; `wpdb` usage; limited user permissions for DB.           |
| **[[Update Management]]**                | Describe the impact of outdated components on security.               | Vulnerability windows; automatic vs manual updates; testing updates safely.                    |

| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Summarize the gold standard for foundational security.                | Keep core updated; use complex passwords; respect roles; use security plugins; audit often.    |
