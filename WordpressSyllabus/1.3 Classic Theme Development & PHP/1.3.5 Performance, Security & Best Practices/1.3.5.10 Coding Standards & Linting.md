**Overview**  
Coding standards and linting are the pillars of professional, collaborative software development. In the WordPress ecosystem, the official coding standards ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and free of common security pitfalls. Adhering to these conventions allows developers from across the globe to contribute to the same project with a consistent style. Linting tools like PHP_CodeSniffer (PHPCS) provide automated feedback, identifying everything from missing documentation to dangerous function usage. A developer who masters these standards produces code that is not only functional but also "WordPress-native"—making it easier to audit, upgrade, and maintain over time.

| **[[WP Coding Standards (WPCS)]]**       | Identify the official WordPress PHP conventions.                       | Naming (snake_case); spacing; bracing; ternary operators; comment formats.                     |
| **[[Naming Conventions]]**               | Describe naming functions, classes, and variables.                     | Descriptive, prefixed names (`mytheme_`); avoiding generic or confusing identifiers.           |
| **[[PHP_CodeSniffer (PHPCS)]]**          | Identify the industry-standard tool for linting PHP.                  | Running rulesets against code; identifying violations; automated fixing (`phpcbf`).             |
| **[[The WP Theme Sniff]]**               | Describe specific rules for theme development.                        | Required template tags; sanitization checks; versioning requirements.                         |
| **[[Linting for Security]]**             | Explain how linting identifies dangerous patterns.                     | Flagging `eval()`, direct SQL, and unescaped variables; ensuring use of nonces.               |
| **[[JS Coding Standards]]**              | Identify WordPress conventions for JavaScript.                        | ES6+ standards; JSDoc requirements; consistency with the WordPress block editor style.         |
| **[[CSS Coding Standards]]**             | Describe conventions for theme styling.                                | BEM (Block Element Modifier) philosophy; selector nesting; property ordering.                  |
| **[[Linting Tools for JS/CSS]]**         | Identify ESLint and Stylelint.                                        | Automated checks for JavaScript and CSS; integrating with modern build tools.                  |
| **[[Automated Code Formatting]]**        | Explain using Prettier with WordPress rules.                          | Opinionated formatting; consistent whitespace; removing style debates from code reviews.       |
| **[[Documentation Standards]]**          | Describe the PHPDoc requirements for functions.                       | `@param`, `@return`, `@since`; ensuring code manifests are accurate and searchable.           |
| **[[Commit Messages]]**                  | Identify clear and descriptive commit styles.                          | Present tense; describing the "what" and "why"; linking to tickets or issues.                  |
| **[[Editor Integration]]**               | Explain setting up VS Code or PHPStorm for WPCS.                       | Extension usage; real-time linting feedback; automatic formatting on save.                     |
| **[[CI/CD Linting]]**                    | Describe running linting in GitHub Actions.                           | Blocking PRs that don't meet standards; ensuring a baseline of quality in shared repos.         |
| **[[Internationalization Prep]]**        | Explain how linting ensures code is i18n ready.                        | Identifying static strings that aren't wrapped in `__()` or `_e()`.                            |
| **[[Handling Legacy Code]]**             | Discuss refactoring older themes to modern standards.                 | Incremental improvements; prioritizing security fixes; documentation updates.                  |

| **[[Code Reviews]]**                     | Explain the role of human review alongside automated linting.          | Checking logic and architecture; identifying issues a linter might miss.                       |
