**Overview**  
Creating custom hooks in your theme makes it extensible by child themes and plugins. By strategically placing `do_action()` and `apply_filters()` calls in your code, you provide entry points for others to modify behavior or inject content without editing your theme files directly. This is the same pattern WordPress core uses, and it's essential for building professional, flexible themes. Custom hooks enable child themes to add features, plugins to integrate seamlessly, and developers to customize without breaking update compatibility. Understanding when and how to create custom hooks is a mark of advanced WordPress development and demonstrates thinking beyond immediate needs to long-term extensibility.
