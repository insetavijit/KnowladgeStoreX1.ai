**Overview**  
Hook priorities control the execution order when multiple callbacks are registered to the same hook. WordPress executes callbacks in ascending priority order (lower numbers first), with the default priority being 10. Understanding priorities is crucial for ensuring your code runs at the right time relative to other theme and plugin code. For example, you might need to run before a plugin modifies content, or after WordPress sets up default behavior. Priority conflicts can cause subtle bugs where code appears to work in isolation but fails when other plugins are active. Mastering priority management is essential for building robust, compatible themes and plugins.

| **[[Priority Concept]]**                 | Explain what hook priorities are and why they matter.                 | Execution order; callback sequencing; dependency management; conflict resolution.               |
| **[[Default Priority]]**                 | Describe the standard priority value.                                 | Default is 10; most core and plugin code uses 10; middle ground; common baseline.              |
| **[[Priority Range]]**                   | Explain the valid priority values.                                    | Typically 1-100; can be negative or higher; practical limits; extreme values.                   |
| **[[Lower Priority = Earlier]]**         | Describe the priority execution order.                                | Lower numbers run first; 1 before 10 before 20; ascending order; counterintuitive naming.      |
| **[[Same Priority Execution]]**          | Explain what happens with identical priorities.                       | Registration order determines sequence; first registered runs first; unpredictable with plugins.|
| **[[Choosing Priorities]]**              | Describe strategies for selecting priority values.                    | Before/after specific code; leaving gaps (5, 15); avoiding conflicts; documentation.            |
| **[[Early Priorities]]**                 | Explain when to use low priority numbers.                             | Running before core/plugins; setup tasks; initialization; priority 1-9.                         |
| **[[Late Priorities]]**                  | Describe when to use high priority numbers.                           | Running after core/plugins; cleanup; final modifications; priority 11-100+.                     |
| **[[Priority Conflicts]]**               | Explain issues when priorities clash.                                 | Unexpected order; plugin conflicts; debugging challenges; resolution strategies.                |
| **[[Debugging Priority Issues]]**        | Describe troubleshooting execution order problems.                    | Query Monitor; logging; testing with/without plugins; priority inspection.                      |
| **[[Core Hook Priorities]]**             | Explain typical WordPress core priority usage.                        | Core often uses 10; some use specific values; understanding core timing; compatibility.         |
| **[[Plugin Priority Patterns]]**         | Describe common plugin priority strategies.                           | Popular plugins' priority choices; avoiding conflicts; ecosystem awareness.                     |
| **[[Priority Best Practices]]**          | Discuss choosing appropriate priorities.                              | Use 10 unless specific need; document reasons; avoid extremes; leave room for adjustment.      |
| **[[Priority in Filters]]**              | Explain priority importance in filter chains.                         | Data transformation order; cumulative modifications; dependency on previous filters.            |
| **[[Priority in Actions]]**              | Describe priority importance in actions.                              | Setup order; initialization sequence; dependency management; timing-critical operations.        |
| **[[Changing Priorities]]**              | Explain modifying existing hook priorities.                           | Remove and re-add with new priority; timing considerations; testing requirements.              |
| **[[Priority Documentation]]**           | Describe documenting priority choices.                                | Inline comments; explaining why specific priority; maintenance; future developers.              |
| **[[Testing Different Priorities]]**     | Explain verifying priority behavior.                                  | Testing with various plugins; edge cases; priority conflicts; compatibility testing.            |
| **[[Common Priority Mistakes]]**         | Identify frequent errors.                                             | Using extreme values unnecessarily; not documenting; assuming order; ignoring conflicts.       |
| **[[Performance Implications]]**         | Discuss priority impact on performance.                               | Minimal overhead; execution order efficiency; optimization considerations.                      |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Describe coding standards for priorities.                             | Use defaults when possible; document deviations; test thoroughly; consider ecosystem.          |
