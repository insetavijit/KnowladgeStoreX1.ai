**Overview**  
Removing and overriding hooks allows you to disable or modify default WordPress, plugin, or parent theme behavior without editing core files. Using `remove_action()` and `remove_filter()`, you can unhook callbacks that were previously registered, while understanding hook context and timing ensures your removal code executes at the right moment. This is essential for child themes customizing parent functionality, themes disabling unwanted plugin features, and developers resolving conflicts between different code sources. Mastering hook removal requires understanding callback references, priorities, and execution timing—getting any of these wrong means your removal code won't work.

| **[[Hook Removal Concept]]**             | Explain why removing hooks is necessary.                              | Disabling features; conflict resolution; customization; child themes; plugin compatibility.     |
| **[[remove_action()]]**                  | Describe removing action callbacks.                                   | `remove_action($hook, $callback, $priority)`; exact parameter matching; timing requirements.   |
| **[[remove_filter()]]**                  | Explain removing filter callbacks.                                    | `remove_filter($hook, $callback, $priority)`; identical to remove_action; filter-specific.     |
| **[[Exact Parameter Matching]]**         | Describe the requirement for identical parameters.                    | Same hook name, callback, priority; case sensitivity; common mistakes; verification.           |
| **[[Callback Reference Matching]]**      | Explain matching callback references correctly.                       | Function names; array for methods; object instances; static vs instance methods.               |
| **[[Timing Requirements]]**              | Describe when removal code must run.                                  | After original registration; before hook fires; hook timing; execution order; dependencies.    |
| **[[Removing Core Hooks]]**              | Explain disabling WordPress default behavior.                         | Core action/filter removal; emoji scripts; version meta; default widgets; customization.       |
| **[[Removing Plugin Hooks]]**            | Describe disabling plugin functionality.                              | Plugin hook removal; conflict resolution; selective disabling; compatibility issues.           |
| **[[Removing Parent Theme Hooks]]**      | Explain child theme customization.                                    | Parent theme hook removal; selective overrides; child theme patterns; inheritance.             |
| **[[Class Method Removal]]**             | Describe removing object method callbacks.                            | `array($instance, 'method')`; singleton patterns; accessing object instances; complexity.      |
| **[[Static Method Removal]]**            | Explain removing static method callbacks.                             | `array('ClassName', 'method')`; class-based removal; static context; simpler than instances.   |
| **[[Anonymous Function Removal]]**       | Describe the challenge of removing closures.                          | Cannot remove anonymous functions; design consideration; named functions for removability.     |
| **[[Checking Before Removal]]**          | Explain verifying hook existence.                                     | `has_action()`, `has_filter()`; conditional removal; avoiding errors; verification.            |
| **[[Priority in Removal]]**              | Describe importance of matching priority.                             | Must match registration priority; common mistake; debugging; exact matching requirement.       |
| **[[Removal Timing Hooks]]**             | Explain proper hooks for removal code.                                | `after_setup_theme`, `init`, `wp_loaded`; timing dependencies; execution order.                |
| **[[Re-adding Modified Hooks]]**         | Describe removing and re-adding with changes.                         | Remove, modify, re-add pattern; priority changes; callback modification; customization.        |
| **[[Debugging Removal Issues]]**         | Explain troubleshooting failed removals.                              | Verifying parameters; checking timing; inspecting callbacks; common errors; Query Monitor.     |
| **[[Child Theme Removal Patterns]]**     | Describe common child theme removal scenarios.                        | Parent hook removal; selective customization; inheritance patterns; best practices.            |
| **[[Plugin Conflict Resolution]]**       | Explain resolving hook conflicts.                                     | Identifying conflicts; selective removal; priority adjustment; compatibility strategies.       |
| **[[Common Removal Mistakes]]**          | Identify frequent errors.                                             | Wrong priority; incorrect timing; callback mismatch; anonymous functions; case sensitivity.    |
| **[[Performance Considerations]]**       | Discuss performance impact of removal.                                | Minimal overhead; avoiding unnecessary removals; optimization; efficiency.                     |
| **[[Best Practices]]**                   | Describe coding standards for hook removal.                           | Proper timing; exact matching; documentation; testing; conditional removal; maintainability.   |
