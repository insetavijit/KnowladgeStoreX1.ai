**Overview**  
The `functions.php` file is the central hub for theme functionality, but without proper organization, it can quickly become an unmaintainable mess of thousands of lines. Professional themes organize their code into logical modules, use includes to separate concerns, implement namespaces or prefixes to avoid conflicts, and follow consistent patterns for readability. A well-organized `functions.php` makes it easier to locate code, debug issues, onboard new developers, and extend functionality without creating chaos. Understanding organizational strategies—from simple file includes to advanced autoloading—is essential for building scalable, maintainable themes.
