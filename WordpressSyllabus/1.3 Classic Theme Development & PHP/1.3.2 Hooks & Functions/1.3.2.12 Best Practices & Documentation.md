**Overview**  
Best practices and documentation for hooks ensure your code is maintainable, understandable, and extensible. This includes clear naming conventions, comprehensive inline documentation, avoiding heavy logic in hooks, proper error handling, and following WordPress coding standards. Well-documented hooks help other developers (and your future self) understand what code does, when it runs, and how to extend it. Professional WordPress development requires not just making code work, but making it readable, maintainable, and following community standards. Mastering these practices distinguishes amateur code from production-ready, professional WordPress development.
