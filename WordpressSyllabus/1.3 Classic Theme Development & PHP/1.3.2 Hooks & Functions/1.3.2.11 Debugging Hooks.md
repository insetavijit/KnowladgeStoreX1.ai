**Overview**  
Debugging hooks is essential for understanding what code is running, when it's running, and in what order. WordPress's hook system can be complex, with dozens of callbacks firing on a single hook, priorities affecting execution order, and interactions between themes, plugins, and core. Tools like Query Monitor, logging, hook inspectors, and custom debugging functions help you trace hook execution, identify which callbacks are registered, verify timing, and troubleshoot issues. Mastering hook debugging techniques enables you to diagnose conflicts, understand plugin behavior, optimize performance, and build more reliable WordPress code.
