**Overview**  
Actions and filters are the two fundamental types of hooks in WordPress, forming the backbone of its plugin and theme architecture. Actions allow you to execute custom code at specific points in WordPress's execution flow, while filters enable you to modify data before it's used or displayed. Understanding the distinction between these two hook types is essential because using the wrong type can lead to bugs, security issues, or unexpected behavior. Actions trigger behavior (like sending emails or registering post types), while filters transform data (like modifying post titles or adding CSS classes). Mastering when to use each hook type is a foundational skill for WordPress development.

| **[[Hook System Concept]]**              | Explain what WordPress hooks are and why they exist.                  | Event-driven architecture; extensibility; separation of concerns; plugin/theme integration.     |
| **[[Actions Explained]]**                | Describe what actions do and when to use them.                        | Execute code at specific points; no return value; side effects; triggering behavior.            |
| **[[Filters Explained]]**                | Explain what filters do and when to use them.                         | Modify data; must return value; transformation; data manipulation.                              |
| **[[Key Differences]]**                  | Compare actions vs filters.                                           | Return values; use cases; execution context; choosing the right type.                           |
| **[[Action Examples]]**                  | Describe common action use cases.                                     | Sending emails; registering post types; enqueueing scripts; database operations.                |
| **[[Filter Examples]]**                  | Explain common filter use cases.                                      | Modifying content; changing titles; adding classes; altering query parameters.                  |
| **[[do_action()]]**                      | Describe how actions are triggered.                                   | Firing action hooks; passing parameters; execution flow; multiple callbacks.                    |
| **[[apply_filters()]]**                  | Explain how filters are applied.                                      | Applying filter hooks; passing data; returning modified values; filter chains.                  |
| **[[Return Values]]**                    | Describe the critical difference in return behavior.                  | Actions ignore returns; filters require returns; common mistake of not returning in filters.    |
| **[[Hook Naming Conventions]]**          | Explain standard naming patterns.                                     | Descriptive names; underscores; context; consistency; WordPress core patterns.                  |
| **[[Multiple Parameters]]**              | Describe passing multiple arguments through hooks.                    | Additional parameters; argument count in add_action/add_filter; accessing in callbacks.         |
| **[[Reference vs Value]]**               | Explain passing by reference in hooks.                                | Modifying objects; array manipulation; reference parameters; side effects.                      |
| **[[Hook Execution Flow]]**              | Describe how hooks execute in sequence.                               | Priority order; multiple callbacks; execution stack; timing.                                    |
| **[[When Actions Become Filters]]**      | Explain edge cases and hybrid scenarios.                              | Actions that pass data; filters with side effects; best practices; clarity.                     |
| **[[Core vs Custom Hooks]]**             | Compare WordPress core hooks vs theme/plugin hooks.                   | Built-in hooks; custom extensibility; documentation; discovery.                                 |
| **[[Hook Documentation]]**               | Describe how to document custom hooks.                                | Inline comments; parameter descriptions; usage examples; developer experience.                  |
