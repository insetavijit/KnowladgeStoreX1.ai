**Overview**  
WordPress provides dozens of core hooks that fire at specific points in the request lifecycle, from initial loading through template rendering to final output. Understanding these key hooks—like `init`, `wp_enqueue_scripts`, `after_setup_theme`, `wp_head`, and `wp_footer`—is essential for knowing when and where to execute your custom code. Each hook serves a specific purpose and fires at a predictable time, allowing you to register post types, enqueue assets, add theme supports, inject header/footer content, and more. Mastering common core hooks is fundamental to WordPress development because they provide the standardized entry points for extending WordPress functionality safely and predictably.
