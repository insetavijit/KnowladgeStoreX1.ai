**Overview**  
A WordPress theme is recognized and loaded based on a small set of mandatory files and headers. The presence of a properly formatted `style.css` header allows WordPress to identify the theme, while `index.php` serves as the ultimate fallback template in the rendering hierarchy. Together with an optional but standard `functions.php` and an admin-facing `screenshot.png`, these files form the **minimum viable theme**. Understanding these requirements is essential because WordPress will not register, activate, or render a theme unless this baseline structure is met, regardless of how advanced the theme’s features may be. Professional development begins with a solid understanding of these core requirements and the metadata that describes a theme's purpose and compatibility.

| **[[Structure Overview]]**               | Explain what makes a WordPress theme valid and how WordPress detects it. | Theme directory in `/wp-content/themes/`; required files; role of headers in discovery.         |
| **[[style.css Headers]]**              | Describe how theme metadata is declared.                                 | `Theme Name`, `Author`, `Version`, `Text Domain`, `Requires at least`, `Requires PHP`.          |
| **[[index.php]]**                      | Explain the role of the fallback template.                               | Main template file; required even if unused; last resort in template hierarchy.                 |
| **[[functions.php]]**                  | Explain how theme functionality is added.                                | Enqueue scripts/styles; theme supports; hooks; no closing PHP tag best practice.                |
| **[[screenshot.png]]**                 | Explain how the theme is visually identified in admin.                   | 1200×900px recommended; PNG/JPG; displayed in Appearance → Themes.                              |
| **[[Theme Folder Naming]]**            | Discuss best practices for theme directory names.                        | Lowercase; no spaces; unique slug; matches text domain.                                         |
| **[[Child Theme Requirements]]**       | Explain what extra files are needed for a child theme.                   | `style.css` with `Template:` header; optional `functions.php`; inherits parent templates.       |
| **[[Theme Activation Checks]]**        | Describe how WordPress validates a theme.                                | Missing file warnings; fatal error handling; admin notices; fallback to default theme.          |
| **[[Classic vs Block Minimum Files]]** | Compare minimum files for classic vs block themes.                       | Classic: `style.css` + `index.php`; Block: `style.css` + `templates/index.html` + `theme.json`. |
| **[[License & URI]]**                  | Explain the role of License and Theme URI headers.                        | GPL compliance (`License`, `License URI`); external project links (`Theme URI`).               |
| **[[Tags & Description]]**             | Describe how tags improve theme searchability.                           | Search filters in the theme repository; descriptive metadata for users.                        |
| **[[Template: Parental Link]]**        | Explain the critical role of the 'Template' header in child themes.       | Mapping to parent directory name; case-sensitivity; failure scenarios.                          |
| **[[Text Domain Registration]]**       | Describe why the Text Domain header must be unique.                       | i18n support; mapping translation files; matching the theme slug.                               |
| **[[Requires at least Support]]**      | Explain declaring minimum WordPress and PHP versions.                     | `Requires at least: 5.0`; `Requires PHP: 7.4`; preventing activation on incompatible hosts.    |
| **[[UTF-8 & Encoding]]**               | Identify the correct encoding for theme files.                            | UTF-8 without BOM; preventing "headers already sent" errors.                                   |
| **[[File System Permissions]]**        | Describe safe server-level permissions for theme folders.                 | 755 for directories, 644 for files; security best practices.                                  |
| **[[The wp-content context]]**         | Explain why themes live in `/themes/` and not `/plugins/`.                | Design vs Functionality; logic separation; WordPress architecture.                             |
| **[[Common Errors & Pitfalls]]**       | Identify mistakes that break theme recognition.                          | Missing headers; wrong comment syntax; incorrect file names; permissions issues.              |
| **[[Theme Validation Tools]]**         | Explain how to verify theme compliance.                                  | Theme Check plugin; WP_DEBUG; manual inspection; coding standards.                              |
| **[[Best Practices Summary]]**         | Summarize the gold standard for starting a theme project.                 | Clear metadata; clean folder structure; minimal required files; valid PHP headers.              |
