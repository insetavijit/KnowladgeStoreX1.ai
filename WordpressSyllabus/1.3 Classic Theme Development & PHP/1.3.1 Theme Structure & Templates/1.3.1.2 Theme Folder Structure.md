**Overview**  
A well-organized theme folder structure is critical for maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. While WordPress enforces minimal file requirements, professional themes adopt consistent directory conventions to separate assets (CSS, JavaScript, images), template parts, includes, and configuration files. A clean structure makes it easier to locate files, debug issues, onboard new developers, and extend functionality without creating chaos. Understanding common naming conventions and organizational patterns ensures your theme remains readable and follows industry best practices, whether you're building a simple blog theme or a complex multi-purpose framework. Professional themes often follow a "Separation of Concerns" model, keeping logic in the back and presentation in the front.

| **[[Standard Directory Layout]]**        | Explain the typical folder structure of a professional WordPress theme. | Root files vs subdirectories; separation of concerns; scalability considerations.               |
| **[[assets/ or inc/assets/]]**           | Describe where and how static assets are organized.                       | CSS, JS, images, fonts; versioning; minified vs source files; build tool outputs.              |
| **[[template-parts/]]**                  | Explain the purpose of reusable template fragments.                       | Used with `get_template_part()`; organized by context (header, footer, content, navigation).   |
| **[[inc/ or includes/]]**                | Discuss where helper functions and feature modules live.                  | Custom functions, class files, configuration; autoloading; modular architecture.               |
| **[[languages/]]**                       | Explain how translation files are stored.                                 | `.pot`, `.po`, `.mo` files; text domain matching; internationalization (i18n) workflow.        |
| **[[page-templates/]]**                  | Describe custom page template organization.                               | Full-width, landing pages, custom layouts; template name headers; user selection in admin.     |
| **[[blocks/ or patterns/]]**             | Explain where block editor assets are stored (if supporting Gutenberg).   | Custom block registration; block patterns; `block.json`; editor styles.                        |
| **[[Naming Conventions]]**               | Discuss best practices for file and folder naming.                        | Lowercase; hyphens vs underscores; descriptive names; consistency across theme.                |
| **[[Root-Level Files]]**                 | Identify which files belong in the theme root.                            | `style.css`, `functions.php`, `index.php`, `screenshot.png`, `readme.txt`, `rtl.css`.          |
| **[[Avoiding Deep Nesting]]**            | Explain why excessive folder depth is problematic.                        | Readability issues; path length limits; cognitive load; balance between organization and flat. |
| **[[Child Theme Structure]]**            | Describe how child themes organize overrides.                             | Mirroring parent structure; selective overrides; `functions.php` enqueue order.                |
| **[[Build Tool Integration]]**           | Explain how modern build tools affect folder structure.                   | `src/` vs `dist/`; Webpack, Gulp, npm scripts; `.gitignore` for compiled assets.               |
| **[[Documentation & Comments]]**         | Discuss the role of inline documentation in theme organization.           | File headers; function docblocks; README files; developer onboarding.                          |
| **[[Security Considerations]]**          | Identify security-related folder structure practices.                     | Restricting direct access; `.htaccess` rules; keeping sensitive files outside web root.        |
| **[[Performance Implications]]**         | Explain how folder structure impacts performance.                         | Asset loading order; HTTP requests; lazy loading; critical CSS placement.                      |
| **[[Version Control Best Practices]]**   | Describe how to structure themes for Git workflows.                       | `.gitignore` patterns; excluding node_modules, vendor; branching strategies.                   |
| **[[Comparing Popular Patterns]]**       | Compare folder structures used by major theme frameworks.                 | Underscores (_s), GeneratePress, Astra, Sage; learning from established patterns.             |
| **[[Vendor/ Composer Support]]**         | Explain where third-party libraries should be stored.                     | `vendor/` directory; Composer integration; staying separate from custom theme code.            |
| **[[dist/ vs build/ folders]]**          | Differentiate between distribution and temporary build folders.           | Compiled assets for production vs temp files during development; gitignore rules.               |
| **[[Best Practices Summary]]**           | Summarize the gold standard for theme organization.                      | Flat root; modular `inc/`; semantic `template-parts/`; versioned `assets/`.                     |
