**Overview**  
Custom taxonomies are classification systems that organize content into meaningful groups. While WordPress provides built-in categories (hierarchical) and tags (flat), custom taxonomies let you create specialized classification schemes for any content type—project types, locations, skills, industries, colors, sizes, and more. Taxonomies can be hierarchical like categories (with parent-child relationships) or flat like tags (simple labels). Understanding when and how to use custom taxonomies is essential for building well-organized, easily navigable content structures. Proper taxonomy design improves user experience, SEO, and content discoverability while providing powerful filtering and organization capabilities.
