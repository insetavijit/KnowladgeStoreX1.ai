**Overview**  
The `pre_get_posts` hook allows you to modify WordPress's main query before it executes, enabling you to change how CPT archives display without creating custom templates or secondary queries. This is essential for customizing posts per page, changing sort order, adding taxonomy filters, or modifying any query parameter for CPT archives. Understanding how to safely modify the main query—checking for the main query, verifying the query context, and avoiding unintended side effects—is crucial for building flexible, performant WordPress sites. Proper main query modification provides powerful customization while maintaining WordPress's standard template structure and pagination.
