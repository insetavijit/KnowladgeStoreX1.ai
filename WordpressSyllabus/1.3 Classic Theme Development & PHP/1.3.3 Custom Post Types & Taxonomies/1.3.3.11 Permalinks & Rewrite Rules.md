**Overview**  
Permalinks and rewrite rules control the URL structure for custom post types and taxonomies. Proper URL configuration ensures SEO-friendly, readable URLs that make sense to users and search engines. Understanding how to configure rewrite slugs, handle hierarchical URLs, flush rewrite rules properly, and troubleshoot permalink conflicts is essential for professional WordPress development. Poor permalink configuration can lead to 404 errors, broken pagination, and SEO problems. Mastering rewrite rules ensures your CPT content is accessible, crawlable, and provides excellent user experiences through clean, meaningful URLs.
