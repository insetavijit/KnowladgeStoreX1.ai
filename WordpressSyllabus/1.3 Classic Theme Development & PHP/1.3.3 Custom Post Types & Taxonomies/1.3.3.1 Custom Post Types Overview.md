**Overview**  
Custom Post Types (CPTs) extend WordPress beyond the default posts and pages to model any type of content your site needs—portfolios, products, events, testimonials, team members, and more. While posts are for blog content and pages are for static content, CPTs let you create distinct content types with their own admin screens, templates, and taxonomies. Understanding when to use CPTs versus categories or custom fields is fundamental to proper WordPress content architecture. CPTs provide structure, organization, and specialized functionality that makes managing diverse content types intuitive and scalable. Mastering CPTs is essential for building content-rich WordPress sites that go beyond simple blogs.
