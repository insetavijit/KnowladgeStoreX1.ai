**Overview**  
Custom post types and taxonomies work together to create powerful, flexible content structures. A single CPT can have multiple taxonomies for different classification schemes (e.g., portfolio items with project types, industries, and skills), and a single taxonomy can be shared across multiple post types (e.g., a "location" taxonomy used by events, team members, and offices). Understanding how to properly link CPTs and taxonomies, when to use shared taxonomies versus dedicated ones, and how these relationships affect queries and templates is essential for building well-architected WordPress sites. Proper linking creates intuitive content organization, powerful filtering capabilities, and excellent user experiences.
