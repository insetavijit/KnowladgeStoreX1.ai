**Overview**  
Querying custom post types requires understanding how to use WP_Query to retrieve CPT content with specific criteria. Whether you're building custom archive pages, related content sections, filtered listings, or complex multi-taxonomy queries, mastering CPT queries is essential. You need to know how to query by post type, filter by taxonomies, order results, handle pagination, and optimize performance. Custom queries enable you to display CPT content anywhere on your site—homepage features, sidebar widgets, custom page templates—with complete control over what content appears and how it's organized. Proper query implementation ensures efficient database operations and excellent user experiences.
