|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Deployment Checklists & Standards Overview**|Explain why formal checklists are critical for reliable WordPress releases.|Risk reduction; repeatability; auditability; team alignment; release discipline.|Checklists turn deployments into predictable, low-risk operations.|
|**[[Pre-Deployment Backups]]**|Ensure data safety before any release.|Full-site backups; DB-only backups; offsite storage; snapshot verification; restore drills.|Backups are the safety net for every deployment.|
|**[[QA & Acceptance Testing]]**|Validate functionality against requirements.|Test plans; critical paths; cross-browser tests; mobile checks; UAT sign-off.|QA confirms the site works as intended.|
|**[[Error & Log Review]]**|Catch hidden issues before go-live.|PHP logs; WP_DEBUG_LOG; server logs; deprecation warnings; clean baseline.|Clean logs indicate release readiness.|
|**[[Dependency & Version Audit]]**|Prevent incompatibility issues.|PHP/WP/plugin/theme versions; changelogs; compatibility matrices; lockfiles.|Version audits avoid breaking changes in production.|
|**[[Security Review]]**|Ensure the release does not introduce risk.|File permissions; secrets; user roles; vulnerability scans; firewall rules.|Security checks protect the site and users.|
|**[[Performance Validation]]**|Confirm no regressions in speed or stability.|Load tests; Core Web Vitals; cache checks; query counts; resource usage.|Performance must not degrade at launch.|
|**[[Content Freeze & Sync]]**|Avoid overwriting live content.|Editorial freeze windows; final DB pulls; selective sync; conflict handling.|Content rules protect live data during deploys.|
|**[[Deployment Steps Runbook]]**|Document the exact release procedure.|Ordered steps; scripts; responsible owners; timing windows; comms plan.|A runbook ensures consistent execution every time.|
|**[[Rollback Plan]]**|Prepare for failure scenarios.|Git revert; redeploy last build; restore backups; DB rollback; DNS considerations.|Rollback plans minimize impact when things go wrong.|
|**[[Post-Deploy Verification]]**|Validate immediately after release.|Smoke tests; admin access; forms; payments; cache flush; monitoring alerts.|Post-checks confirm the site is healthy.|
|**[[Documentation & Handover]]**|Ensure knowledge transfer and future maintainability.|Release notes; env details; credentials handling; ops docs; client handoff.|Documentation makes deployments repeatable and supportable.|
|**[[Common Release Pitfalls]]**|Identify failures that checklists prevent.|Skipped backups; untested changes; manual FTP drift; no rollback; poor comms.|Most outages stem from skipping basic release discipline.|
