| **Local Environment Tools Overview**        | Explain why local development environments are critical for professional WordPress workflows. | Purpose: isolated dev stacks; offline development; parity with production; faster iteration; risk-free testing.  |
| **[[What is a Local Dev Environment]]**     | Define a local WordPress environment and contrast it with live/server-based development.      | Local stack = OS + web server + PHP + MySQL/MariaDB + WordPress; localhost; hosts mapping; virtual sites.        |
| **[[Popular Local Dev Platforms]]**         | Identify common tools and justify when to choose each.                                        | Tools: LocalWP, DevKinsta, Studio by WordPress.com, Docker-based wp-env, XAMPP/MAMP; GUI vs Docker; OS support.  |
| **[[Stack Architecture]]**                  | Describe the underlying components that power local WordPress sites.                          | Web servers (Apache/Nginx); PHP versions & switching; DB engines; mail catching; HTTPS; file system layout.      |
| **[[Environment Parity]]**                  | Explain why matching local, staging, and production matters.                                  | Same PHP/MySQL versions; server type; config sync; wp-config; avoiding “works on my machine” issues.             |
| **[[Workflow Integration]]**                | Show how local tools fit into daily dev workflows.                                            | Site cloning; push/pull to staging; Git integration; WP-CLI usage; database search-replace; multisite handling.  |
| **[[Debugging & Dev Settings]]**            | Demonstrate how to enable debugging in local setups.                                          | WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG; error display; Xdebug; log files; query monitor; mailhog.                                |
| **[[Multi-Site & Multi-Project Handling]]** | Explain managing multiple WordPress installs efficiently.                                     | Multiple sites per tool; isolated containers; resource management; naming conventions; backups/snapshots.        |
| **[[Performance & Limits]]**                | Discuss performance characteristics and constraints of local environments.                    | CPU/RAM allocation; disk I/O; Docker overhead; when local differs from production; caching differences.          |
| **[[Common Pitfalls]]**                     | Identify frequent issues and how to mitigate them.                                            | Port conflicts; SSL issues; file permissions; large DB imports; PHP extension mismatches; path case-sensitivity. |
| **[[When to Use Which Tool]]**              | Recommend tools based on use case and team context.                                           | Solo dev vs teams; Docker for CI parity; GUI tools for speed; client handoff needs; cross-OS consistency.        |
| **[[Role in Professional Setup]]**          | Position local environments in a modern WordPress dev lifecycle.                              | Dev → staging → production flow; CI/CD hooks; reproducibility; onboarding new devs quickly.                      |

If you want, I can also compress this into a single-row version to exactly mirror your original 4-column table style.
