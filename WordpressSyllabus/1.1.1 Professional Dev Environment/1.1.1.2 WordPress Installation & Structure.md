|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**WordPress Installation & Structure Overview**|Explain how WordPress is installed and why its file structure matters for development.|Core install process; manual vs one-click installs; root vs subdirectory; single vs multisite.|WordPress installation sets up the core files and layout that everything else builds upon.|
|**[[Core Directory Layout]]**|Identify major WordPress directories and their roles.|`/wp-admin`, `/wp-includes`, `/wp-content`; separation of core vs user content; update behavior.|Core directories separate engine code from user-managed content.|
|**[[Themes & Plugins Structure]]**|Describe where and how themes and plugins live.|`/wp-content/themes`, `/wp-content/plugins`, mu-plugins; child themes; load order.|Themes control presentation, plugins extend functionality.|
|**[[wp-config.php Deep Dive]]**|Explain configuration and environment control via config file.|DB credentials; `WP_DEBUG`; salts & keys; table prefix; env constants; local overrides.|`wp-config.php` governs database access and environment behavior.|
|**[[Uploads & Content Organization]]**|Show how media and content are stored.|`/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM`; permissions; offloading; symlinks; .htaccess rules.|Media lives in uploads, organized by date unless customized.|
|**[[Installation Methods]]**|Compare different installation approaches.|One-click installers; WP-CLI `wp core install`; manual unzip; Composer-based setups.|WordPress can be installed via GUI, CLI, or automated workflows.|
|**[[Single vs Multisite Layout]]**|Distinguish file and DB structure differences.|Multisite constants; network setup; shared core; blogs.dir legacy; site tables.|Multisite shares core files but manages multiple sites from one install.|
|**[[File Permissions & Ownership]]**|Discuss secure and functional permissions.|755/644 norms; www-data ownership; chmod/chown; writable dirs; security risks.|Correct permissions keep WordPress secure and update-friendly.|
|**[[Versioning & Updates]]**|Explain how WordPress updates affect structure.|Core auto-updates; overwrite behavior; never edit core; update-safe custom code.|Core updates replace engine files but preserve content directories.|
|**[[Environment-Specific Structure]]**|Show how structure varies across dev/staging/prod.|`.env` usage; config splits; symlinked content; Bedrock-style layouts.|Structure can be adapted per environment for cleaner workflows.|
|**[[Common Mistakes]]**|Identify errors new developers make.|Editing core files; misplacing plugins; wrong paths; exposing config; committing secrets.|Most issues come from misunderstanding what files are safe to touch.|

If you want this compressed back into a single-row entry to match your syllabus table, I can provide that as well.
