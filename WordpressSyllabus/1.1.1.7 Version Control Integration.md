|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Version Control Integration Overview**|Explain why version control is mandatory for professional WordPress development.|Source of truth; history; rollback; collaboration; auditability; CI/CD triggers.|Version control tracks every change and enables safe collaboration.|
|**[[Why Git for WordPress]]**|Justify Git usage in WordPress projects.|Core not tracked; track themes/plugins; config strategy; content vs code separation.|Git manages code, not content or core files.|
|**[[Repository Structure]]**|Describe a clean repo layout for WP projects.|Theme-only repo; full-site repo; Bedrock-style; submodules; vendor dirs.|Repo structure defines what is versioned and deployed.|
|**[[.gitignore for WordPress]]**|Show mastery of ignoring generated/sensitive files.|Ignore `/wp-content/uploads`; core files; `wp-config.php`; logs; caches; env files.|`.gitignore` keeps repos clean and secure.|
|**[[Branching Strategy]]**|Explain how teams isolate work.|main/master vs develop; feature branches; hotfix branches; Gitflow vs trunk-based.|Branches isolate changes until they are ready to merge.|
|**[[Commit Conventions]]**|Demonstrate disciplined commit practices.|Atomic commits; imperative messages; scopes; Conventional Commits; linking issues.|Good commits document intent, not just diffs.|
|**[[Collaboration Workflow]]**|Describe team workflows for merging code.|Pull requests; code reviews; conflict resolution; approvals; protected branches.|PRs enable review and shared code ownership.|
|**[[Environment Sync via Git]]**|Explain how code moves across environments.|Dev → staging → prod; deploy keys; hooks; avoiding DB/media in Git.|Git moves code, not stateful data.|
|**[[Git with Local Environments]]**|Integrate Git into daily local dev work.|Repo per site; mapping to local paths; multiple repos; SSH keys.|Local sites are backed by Git repos for versioned work.|
|**[[CI/CD Integration]]**|Show how Git triggers automation.|Pipelines on push; tests; linting; build steps; deploy jobs.|Git events drive automated quality and deployment pipelines.|
|**[[Handling Secrets & Config]]**|Keep sensitive data out of repos.|Env vars; `.env` files; secret managers; sample configs.|Secrets must never live in Git.|
|**[[Common Git Pitfalls]]**|Identify mistakes in WP Git workflows.|Committing core; merge conflicts in built files; large binaries; rewriting shared history.|Most Git issues come from poor repo hygiene and workflows.|
