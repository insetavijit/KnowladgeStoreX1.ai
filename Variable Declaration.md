| **Concept**                   | **Brief**                                                                      |

| **[[Name Binding]]**          | A variable name is bound to an object in memory, not a storage container.      |
| **Assignment Operator (`=`)** | Binds a name to an object; it does not copy the value.                         |
| **Reassignment**              | Rebinding a name to a different object; the previous object remains unchanged. |
| **Dynamic Typing**            | The same variable name can bind to objects of different types over time.       |
| **Multiple Assignment**       | Multiple names can reference the same object (`a = b = 10`).                   |
| **Object Identity**           | Variables reference object identities, not raw values.                         |
| **Immutability Implication**  | Reassignment never mutates immutable objects like `int` or `str`.              |
| **Scope-Aware Binding**       | Name binding occurs within a scope (local, enclosing, global, built-in).       |
| **Garbage Collection**        | Objects with no remaining references are eligible for garbage collection.      |
