    - **1.2.2 Multi-Agent Architectures** — How agent teams are structured.
        
        - **Centralized (Supervisor–Worker)** — One controller assigns tasks and aggregates results.
            
        - **Decentralized (Peer-to-Peer)** — Agents coordinate as equals without central control.
            
        - **Hierarchical** — Leaders manage sub-teams of agents.
            
        - **Equi-level collaborative** — Peers jointly solve with shared responsibility.
            
        - **Hybrid architectures** — Mix centralized and decentralized patterns.
            
        - **Architecture selection** — Choose based on task coupling and control needs.
            
        - **Scalability** — How well the system grows with more agents.
            
    - **1.2.3 Agent Communication Patterns** — How agents share information.
        
        - **Shared scratchpad** — Common memory visible to all agents.
            
        - **Independent contexts** — Each agent keeps private state.
            
        - **Relay / handoff** — Output of one becomes input to next.
            
        - **Broadcast** — One agent sends to all.
            
        - **Publish–subscribe** — Agents subscribe to topics/events.
            
        - **Direct messaging** — Point-to-point communication.
            
        - **Message formats** — Structured vs free-text exchanges.
            
        - **Efficiency vs clarity** — Fewer messages vs richer context.
            
        - **Async vs sync** — Parallel vs turn-based coordination.
            
    - **1.2.4 Agent Roles & Specialization** — Assigning responsibilities in teams.
        
        - **Role definition** — Researcher, coder, reviewer, critic, coordinator.
            
        - **Role-based prompting** — Tailor prompts per responsibility.
            
        - **Expertise modeling** — Each agent tuned for a domain.
            
        - **Tool assignment** — Give tools only to relevant roles.
            
        - **Avoiding role confusion** — Clear boundaries of responsibility.
            
        - **Role composition** — Combining roles in pipelines or teams.
            
        - **Dynamic roles** — Assign or change roles at runtime.
            
    - **1.2.5 Consensus & Decision Making** — How teams agree on outcomes.
        
        - **Voting mechanisms** — Majority or weighted votes.
            
        - **Leader decision** — Supervisor makes final call.
            
        - **Debate-based consensus** — Argue to refine answers.
            
        - **Conflict resolution** — Handle contradictory outputs.
            
        - **Ensemble decisions** — Aggregate multiple answers.
            
        - **Tie-breaking** — Rules for deadlocks.
            
        - **When to vote vs lead** — Trade autonomy for control.
            
    - **1.2.6 Advanced Coordination: Debate & Reflection** — Higher-order team reasoning.
        
        - **Multi-agent debate** — Agents argue opposing positions.
            
        - **Reflection agents** — Critics review and improve outputs.
            
        - **Meta-agents** — Monitor and guide other agents.
            
        - **Self-improving teams** — Learn from past runs.
            
        - **Critic–generator pattern** — One produces, another evaluates.
            
        - **Debate safeguards** — Prevent hallucinated or deceptive arguments.
            
        - **When debate helps** — Complex reasoning tasks.
            
        - **When debate hurts** — Simple tasks, added noise/cost.
            
        - **Ensemble methods** — Combine multiple perspectives for robustness.
