| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Generating collections based on the physical file location or directory structure using `inputPath` or glob selection. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **`getFilteredByGlob`**: Built-in helper `collection.getFilteredByGlob("src/posts/*.md")`.<br>- **Multiple Globs**: Passing an array of patterns to include multiple locations.<br>- **Input Path**: Manually filtering `item.inputPath` via `.includes()`.<br>- **Directory Scoping**: Useful for separating "blog" from "notes" based on folders.<br>- **Negative Globs**: Excluding patterns (though often easier with filter). |
| **One-Line Recall** | Selecting content based on file system paths or glob patterns. |
