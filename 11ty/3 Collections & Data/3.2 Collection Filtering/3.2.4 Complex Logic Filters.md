# 3.2.4 Complex Logic Filters

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Implementing multi-condition logic to create highly specific collections, such as "featured posts from 2023 that are not drafts". |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Compound Conditions**: `item.data.featured && item.date.getFullYear() === 2023`.<br>- **Exclusion Logic**: Removing items with specific flags (`!item.data.draft`).<br>- **Cross-Reference**: Filtering items that share a tag with another item.<br>- **Environmental Logic**: Showing drafts only in `process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV === 'dev'`.<br>- **Tag Intersection**: Items that have *both* tag A and tag B. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Combining multiple boolean conditions to create precise custom collections. |
