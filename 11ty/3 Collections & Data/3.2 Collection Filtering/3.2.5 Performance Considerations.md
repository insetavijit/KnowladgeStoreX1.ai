# 3.2.5 Performance Considerations

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Best practices for defining collections to ensure the build process remains fast, especially as the number of pages scales into the thousands. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Avoid Heavy Compute**: Doing expensive calculations inside the filter loop runs N times.<br>- **Memoization**: ensuring `addCollection` callback logic is efficient.<br>- **Filter Early**: Reduce the array size as early as possible before complex operations.<br>- **FileSystem Access**: Avoid reading files synchronously inside the loop if possible.<br>- **Reference Checks**: Comparison by reference is faster than deep object comparison. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Optimizing collection logic to prevent build slowdowns on large sites. |
