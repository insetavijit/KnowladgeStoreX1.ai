# 3.2.2 Filtering by Date

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Creating collections that group content by temporal criteria, such as "posts from 2023", "future events", or "past archives". |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Date Object**: Accessing `item.date` (JS Date object).<br>- **Comparison**: `item.date > new Date('2023-01-01')`.<br>- **Future Filtering**: Hiding posts with dates in the future (unless in dev mode).<br>- **Year/Month Groups**: Extracting year `item.date.getFullYear()` for grouping.<br>- **Timezone**: Being aware of UTC vs local time in builds. |
| **One-Line Recall** | isolating content subsets based on the `date` property comparison. |
