# 3.7.3 Dependent Variables

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Creating a chain of data variables where one computed value depends on the result of another computed value. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Resolution Order**: Eleventy attempts to resolve dependencies in order.<br>- **Chaining**: `varA` depends on `varB`, `varB` depends on `global`.<br>- **Reflexive**: `title: "{{ title }} - postfix"` (using the original value).<br>- **Limits**: Deep dependency chains can be hard to debug.<br>- **Unresolved**: accessing a variable that hasn't been computed yet returns a proxy or undefined. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Chaining computed properties so that one calculation builds upon the result of another. |
