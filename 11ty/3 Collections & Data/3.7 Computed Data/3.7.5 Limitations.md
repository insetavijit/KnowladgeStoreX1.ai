# 3.7.5 Limitations

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Understanding constraints and potential pitfalls when using `eleventyComputed` to avoid circular logic or performance issues. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Circular Dependencies**: A depends on B, B depends on A (causes error).<br>- **Performance**: Heavy computation in front matter slows down builds.<br>- **Debugging**: Harder to trace where a value came from (Source map is complex).<br>- **Plugin Compat**: Some plugins expect data to be ready *before* computed phase.<br>- **Complexity**: Overuse can make data flow very hard to reason about. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Knowing the boundaries of computed data, specifically regarding circular references and compile-time costs. |
