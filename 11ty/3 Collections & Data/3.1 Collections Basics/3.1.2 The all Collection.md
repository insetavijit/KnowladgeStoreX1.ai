# 3.1.2 The `all` Collection

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Leveraging the special, automatically generated `collections.all` to access every content page in the site, useful for sitemaps, search indexes, or global archives. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Universal Access**: Contains every processed template that has an output URL.<br>- **Iteration**: `{% for post in collections.all %}` loops through everything.<br>- **Exclusion**: Using `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true` in front matter to hide items.<br>- **Sorting**: Default sort is by date; can be customized.<br>- **Performance**: Iterating over `all` can be expensive on large sites. |
| **One-Line Recall** | A built-in collection containing every page on the site, controllable via exclusion. |
