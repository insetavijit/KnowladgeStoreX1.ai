| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Techniques for inspecting the contents of collections during the build process to troubleshoot issues with missing items, incorrect sorting, or data availability. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Console Logging**: `console.log` inside `.eleventy.js` config or `addCollection` callbacks.<br>- **JSON Filter**: Using `{{ collections.myCollection | log }}` or `| json` filter (carefully).<br>- **Limit Output**: Inspecting just one item (`[0]`) to avoid flooding the console.<br>- **Check Exclusions**: Verifying `eleventyExcludeFromCollections` isn't accidentally set.<br>- **Draft Mode**: ensuring drafts aren't hidden if you expect them. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Methods like console logging and filters to inspect collection structures and verify contents. |
