| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Understanding how Eleventy sorts collections by default when no explicit sort order is defined, typically relying on the content's creation date. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Date-Based**: By default, sorted ascending by `date` (oldest to newest).<br>- **File Creation**: If no `date` in front matter, file creation date is used (OS dependent).<br>- **Filename Dates**: Extracts date from filenames like `2023-01-01-post.md`.<br>- **Stable Sort**: Generally stable, but can be unpredictable without explicit dates.<br>- **Importance of `date`**: Always verify front matter dates for consistent ordering. |
| **One-Line Recall** | The built-in ascending sort order based on the `date` property (front matter or file stat). |
