# 3.3.4 Sorting by Title or Alpha

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Organizing content alphabetically by title or name, common for glossaries, documentation indexes, or contact lists. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **String Comparison**: Using `a.data.title.localeCompare(b.data.title)`.<br>- **Case Sensitivity**: Handling "apple" vs "Banana" (usually prefer case-insensitive).<br>- **Locale Aware**: Ensuring correct sorting for non-English characters.<br>- **Fallback**: Sorting by filename if title is missing.<br>- **Performance**: Sorting relatively fast for reasonable collection sizes. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Sorting Strings alphabetically, usually based on the `title` front matter. |
