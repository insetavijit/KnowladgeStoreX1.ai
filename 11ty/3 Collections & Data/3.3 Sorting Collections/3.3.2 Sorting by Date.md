| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Explicitly controlling chronological ordering, ensuring posts appear in the correct timeline sequence, often involving reversing default order for "newest first". |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Front Matter Date**: Utilizing `date: 2023-10-25` explicitly.<br>- **Last Modified**: Using `date: Last Modified` (git-based or fs-based).<br>- **Reverse Order**: Applying `| reverse` filter to show newest posts first.<br>- **Comparison Logic**: `(a, b) => b.date - a.date` in custom sorts.<br>- **Consistency**: Ensuring all items in a collection have valid date objects. |
| **One-Line Recall** | Organizing content chronologically using the `date` field, often reversed for blogs. |
