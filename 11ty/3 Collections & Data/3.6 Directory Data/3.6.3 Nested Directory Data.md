# 3.6.3 Nested Directory Data

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Understanding how data cascades through a nested folder structure (e.g., `blog/2023/posts/`), merging data at each level. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Cascade Flow**: `blog.json` merges into `2023.json` merges into `posts.json`.<br>- **Deep Merging**: Tags are typically combined (e.g., `["blog"]` + `["2023"]`).<br>- **Overrides**: Deeper directory data overrides shallower directory data.<br>- **Organization**: allows creating highly structured content hierarchies with shared attributes.<br>- **Visualization**: Important to track where specific values are coming from in deep nests. |
| **One-Line Recall** | The hierarchical merging of data files from parent folders down to child subdirectories. |
