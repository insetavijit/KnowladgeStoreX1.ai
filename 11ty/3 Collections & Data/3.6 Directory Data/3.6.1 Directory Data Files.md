# 3.6.1 Directory Data Files

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Applying data to all files within a specific folder using a JSON or JS file that matches the folder's name. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Naming Convention**: In folder `posts/`, create `posts.json` or `posts.11tydata.json`.<br>- **Scope**: Data applies to every template file inside `posts/`.<br>- **Simplicity**: Easier than adding the same front matter to 100 files.<br>- **Precedence**: Overridden by specific file front matter, overrides global data.<br>- **Location**: Must sit directly inside the folder it applies to. |
| **One-Line Recall** | A data file sharing the folder's name that applies its content to all files in that folder. |
