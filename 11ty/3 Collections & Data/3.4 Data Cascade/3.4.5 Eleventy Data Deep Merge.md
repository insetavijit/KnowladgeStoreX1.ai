# 3.4.5 Eleventy Data Deep Merge

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Configuring the `setDataDeepMerge` option to control how aggressively Eleventy combines complex data structures from different sources. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Default (v1.0+)**: Deep merge is `true` by default in newer versions.<br>- **Behavior**: Recursively merges objects and concatenates arrays (mostly).<br>- **Opt-Out**: Can be disabled to revert to shallow merges (file overrides object completely).<br>- **Use Case**: Combining `tags` from directory data and front matter.<br>- **Pitfall**: Accidental array duplication if not careful with deep merges. |
| **One-Line Recall** | The setting that controls whether objects/arrays are recursively combined or simply replaced. |
