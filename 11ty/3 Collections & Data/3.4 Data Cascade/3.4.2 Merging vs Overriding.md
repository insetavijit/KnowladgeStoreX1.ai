# 3.4.2 Merging vs Overriding

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | Distinguishing between how simple values are replaced and how objects/arrays are combined during the data cascade. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Primitives**: Strings, numbers, and booleans are **overridden** (last winner takes all).<br>- **Objects**: Objects are typically **merged** (keys combined), depending on configuration.<br>- **Arrays**: Arrays can be merged (concatenated) or overridden depending on `eleventyDataDeepMerge`.<br>- **Control**: Using `override:` prefix (rare) or configuration to control behavior.<br>- **Tags**: Special handling where tags are often merged (combined). |
| **One-Line Recall** | Understanding that basic values get replaced while objects typically get combined. |
