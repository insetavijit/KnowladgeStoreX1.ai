# 3.4.3 Data Sources Priority

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus & Purpose** | A deep dive into determining specifically where a piece of data originates from when debugging unexpected values. |
| **Key Concepts / Details** | - **Specificity Wins**: More specific (closer to the file) generally wins.<br>- **Layout Chain**: Child layout data overrides parent layout data.<br>- **API Overrides**: Data added via `contentMap` or filters.<br>- **Debugging**: Using the `| log` filter to inspect the final resolved object.<br>- **Environment**: Understanding how `process.env` might inject data globally. |
| **One-Line Recall** | The rule that localized data (front matter) generally supersedes broad data (global/directory). |
