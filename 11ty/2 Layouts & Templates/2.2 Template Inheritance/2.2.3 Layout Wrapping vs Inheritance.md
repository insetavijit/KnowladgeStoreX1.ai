| **2.2.3 Layout Wrapping vs Inheritance** | Architectural choice | Chaining (11ty) vs Extending (Nunjucks); when to use which | Wrappers go outside, Extensions go inside. |
| **[[2.2.3.1 Concept Comparison]]** | Mental Model | Wrapper = shell (HTML); Extension = replacement (Logic). | Understand the structural difference. |
| **[[2.2.3.2 When to Wrap]]** | Use Cases | Generic page shells; markdown content; simple parent/child structures | Wrap for general structure. |
| **[[2.2.3.3 When to Extend]]** | Use Cases | Specific page variations; overriding generic blocks; complex logic | Extend for specific modifications. |
| **[[2.2.3.4 Hybrid Approach]]** | Mixing Both | Using `layout` front matter on a file that uses `{% extends %}` (be careful) | You can mix them, but be careful. |
| **[[2.2.3.5 Performance Implications]]** | Optimization | Inheritance is often faster (engine native) vs wrapping (11ty processing) | Extensions are engine-native and fast. |
