| **2.7.6 WebC vs Other Frameworks** | Comparison | React/Vue vs WebC; build-time vs runtime | Why use WebC? |
| **[[2.7.6.1 Build-time First]]** | Philosophy | WebC runs at build time; outputs HTML; 0kB client JS by default | It's for the server build. |
| **[[2.7.6.2 Vs React/Vue]]** | Runtime | React hydrates (JS cost); WebC sends HTML (No cost) | Cheaper than hydration. |
| **[[2.7.6.3 Vs Nunjucks Macros]]** | Ergonomics | WebC uses HTML syntax vs Nunjucks function syntax; scoped styles | Easier syntax + styles. |
| **[[2.7.6.4 Migration Path]]** | Strategy | Slowly replacing includes with WebC; mixing engines works fine | Mix and match. |
| **[[2.7.6.5 When to use Frameworks]]** | Boundary | Use React for complex *state* (dashboards); use WebC for *content* | Use React for apps, WebC for sites. |
