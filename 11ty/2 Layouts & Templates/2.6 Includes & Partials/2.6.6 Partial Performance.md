| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.6.6 Partial Performance** | Efficiency | Cache; overhead; excessive IO | Keeping includes fast. |
| **[[2.6.6.1 Include Overhead]]** | Concept | Reading files takes time; thousands of includes add up | Reading files isn't free. |
| **[[2.6.6.2 Caching Strategies]]** | Speed | Memoization; ensuring repeatedly used includes are fast | Remember what you read. |
| **[[2.6.6.3 Circular Includes]]** | Problem | Infinite loops; A includes B includes A; stack overflow | Don't create infinite loops. |
| **[[2.6.6.4 Profiling]]** | Debugging | Using `--debug` or profiler output to spot slow templates | Find the bottleneck. |
| **[[2.6.6.5 Inline vs Include]]** | Tradeoff | When to put code in layout vs separate file; maintenance vs speed | Balance cleanliness and speed. |
