### **[[1.1.1 What are LLM Agents]] — Subtopics**

| **Section**                                       | **Focus**              | **Key Utilities / Concepts**                                              | **One-Line Recall**                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[1.1.1.1 LLM Agents Overview]]**               | Definition & paradigm  | autonomous systems, LLM as reasoning core, environment interaction, goals | LLM agents are autonomous systems that use language models to reason and act in an environment. |
| **[[1.1.1.2 Agent vs Chatbot]]**                  | Interaction model      | reactive replies, autonomy, control loop, statefulness                    | Chatbots respond to inputs; agents decide actions to achieve goals.                             |
| **[[1.1.1.3 Autonomy & Goal-Directed Behavior]]** | Behavioral foundation  | self-initiation, objectives, termination criteria, minimal supervision    | Agents operate independently toward explicit goals with minimal human control.                  |
| **[[1.1.1.4 Core Agent Capabilities]]**           | Functional scope       | reasoning, planning, tool use, memory, reflection                         | An agent reasons, plans steps, uses tools, and remembers to solve tasks.                        |
| **[[1.1.1.5 ReAct Pattern]]**                     | Execution pattern      | reasoning–action loop, observations, stepwise control, feedback           | ReAct interleaves reasoning with actions to guide multi-step behavior.                          |
| **[[1.1.1.6 When Agents Are Appropriate]]**       | Applicability          | multi-step tasks, open-ended problems, exploration, orchestration         | Use agents when problems require dynamic planning and tool orchestration.                       |
| **[[1.1.1.7 When Simple LLM Calls Suffice]]**     | Scope boundary         | single-turn prompts, stateless tasks, deterministic outputs, cost control | Prefer simple LLM calls when autonomy adds no practical value.                                  |
| **[[1.1.1.8 Agent vs Workflow]]**                 | Architectural contrast | dynamic paths, decision making, fixed DAGs, flexibility vs predictability | Workflows follow fixed paths; agents choose paths at runtime.                                   |
| **[[1.1.1.9 Agent vs Pipeline]]**                 | Processing model       | non-linear loops, adaptive flow, linear stages, determinism               | Pipelines are linear and deterministic; agents are adaptive and loop-driven.                    |
| **[[1.1.1.10 Agent Paradigm Shift]]**             | Industry framing       | prompt → system, generation → action, autonomy-first design               | LLM agents mark the shift from prompt-based text generation to autonomous AI systems.           |

### ✅ Improvements Applied

- **Sharper Focus labels** (consistent noun phrases).
    
- **Expanded capabilities** to include reflection where relevant.
    
- **Clearer architectural contrasts** (workflow vs pipeline).
    
- **Interview-grade recalls** — concise, definitional, assertive.
    
- **Doctrine-aligned** with autonomy, ReAct, workflows, and paradigm shift.

If you approve this version, I can continue and produce the same improved tables for:

- **1.1.2 Agent Architecture Components**,
    
- **1.1.3 Agent Types & Categories**, and onward through **1.5** using this exact pattern.
