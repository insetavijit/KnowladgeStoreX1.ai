|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Staging & Workflow Pipelines Overview**|Explain why staged pipelines are critical for safe WordPress delivery.|Dev → staging → production flow; risk reduction; validation gates; rollback readiness.|Pipelines move changes safely from development to live sites.|
|**[[Environment Roles]]**|Define the purpose of dev, staging, and prod.|Dev for building; staging for testing; prod for users; access controls.|Each environment serves a distinct role in the lifecycle.|
|**[[Staging Setup Options]]**|Compare ways to provision staging environments.|Host-provided staging; subdomains; clones; containerized envs; credentials isolation.|Staging mirrors production without user traffic.|
|**[[Push/Pull Workflows]]**|Explain how code and data move between envs.|Push code; pull DB/media; selective sync; dry runs; conflict handling.|Push/pull keeps environments aligned.|
|**[[CI/CD Pipelines]]**|Describe automated pipelines triggered by Git.|Build/test/deploy stages; GitHub Actions/GitLab CI; artifacts; secrets handling.|CI/CD automates validation and deployment.|
|**[[Deployment Strategies]]**|Justify different release approaches.|FTP vs SSH; rsync; Git deploy; atomic releases; blue-green; zero-downtime.|Strategy defines how safely changes reach production.|
|**[[Pre-Deploy Checks]]**|Show readiness validation before go-live.|Linting; unit tests; WP-CLI health checks; cache warmups; backups.|Checks prevent broken releases.|
|**[[Post-Deploy Tasks]]**|Explain after-release hygiene.|Cache flush; DB migrations; permalinks flush; smoke tests; monitoring.|Post-deploy steps stabilize the site.|
|**[[Rollback & Recovery]]**|Handle failed deployments.|Git revert; restore backups; redeploy last good build; DB snapshot restore.|Rollbacks minimize downtime and impact.|
|**[[Content Freeze & Sync Rules]]**|Prevent overwriting live content.|Editorial freezes; selective DB sync; prod-to-staging pulls only; merge strategies.|Clear rules protect live data.|
|**[[Access & Security Controls]]**|Secure non-prod environments.|Password protection; IP allowlists; robots.txt; no-index; secret separation.|Staging must be secure and invisible to search engines.|
|**[[Common Pipeline Pitfalls]]**|Identify mistakes in staging workflows.|Manual FTP drift; env mismatch; skipping staging; untested scripts; no backups.|Most failures come from bypassing the pipeline.|
