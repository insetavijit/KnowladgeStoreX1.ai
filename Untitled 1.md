## Thailand's Role as Host

Thailand brings substantial experience to the 2026 Games, having successfully hosted previous editions in 2008 and 2014. The host nation has committed to delivering competition venues certified to IPC standards, ensuring level playing fields for all classification groups.

Preparations include upgraded accessible athlete villages with barrier-free accommodations, specialized medical and sports science support facilities, and trained volunteer corps educated in disability etiquette and sport-specific protocols. Transportation systems connecting venues will feature universal design elements, while legacy planning ensures facilities remain accessible to Thailand's domestic para-athlete community after international competition concludes.

The organizing committee is working with local and international classification panels to ensure proper athlete evaluation, collaborating with technical delegates from international sport federations, and implementing anti-doping protocols consistent with World Para Athletics and IPC standards.

## Beyond the Medal Count

The 13th ASEAN Para Games will leave measurable impacts extending beyond podium finishes. Infrastructure improvements mandated by accessibility standards will serve Thai citizens with disabilities for decades. Increased media coverage of elite para-athletes challenges public assumptions and expands role models for young people with disabilities considering competitive sports.

For athletes, the Games represent more than regional medals—they provide the competitive experience, international exposure, and qualifying performances necessary to advance their careers toward the Asian Para Games and Paralympic stages. The event strengthens Southeast Asia's position in global para-sports by developing coaching expertise, officiating capacity, and classification knowledge essential for sustained competitive excellence.

As preparations continue throughout 2026, the ASEAN Para Games reaffirms the region's commitment to high-performance adaptive sports and the athletes who dedicate themselves to competitive excellence.
