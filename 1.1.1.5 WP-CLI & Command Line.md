|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**WP-CLI & Command Line Overview**|Explain why command-line tooling is essential for modern WordPress workflows.|Automation; speed vs UI; repeatability; scripting; CI/CD integration.|WP-CLI enables fast, scriptable control of WordPress from the shell.|
|**[[What is WP-CLI]]**|Define WP-CLI and its role in WordPress management.|PHP Phar tool; runs in WP context; requires WP install; global vs project install.|WP-CLI is the official command-line interface for WordPress.|
|**[[Core WP-CLI Commands]]**|Demonstrate mastery of common operational commands.|`wp core install/update`; `wp plugin install/activate`; `wp theme install/activate`; `wp user`; `wp option`.|Core commands manage installs, extensions, users, and settings.|
|**[[Site Bootstrap via CLI]]**|Explain bootstrapping a full site without UI.|Download core; create config; DB create; install; language set; admin creation.|Entire sites can be provisioned end-to-end via CLI.|
|**[[Database Operations]]**|Show DB management via command line.|`wp db export/import`; `wp db reset`; `wp search-replace`; dry runs; serialized safety.|WP-CLI safely handles WordPress DB operations.|
|**[[Content & User Automation]]**|Automate routine content tasks.|`wp post generate`; `wp media import`; `wp user create`; batch scripts.|CLI can seed and manage content and users at scale.|
|**[[Custom Scripts & Bash Integration]]**|Describe combining WP-CLI with shell scripts.|Bash/Zsh loops; env vars; `.sh` scripts; Makefiles; cross-site automation.|Scripts turn WP-CLI into full automation pipelines.|
|**[[Custom WP-CLI Commands]]**|Explain extending WP-CLI for project needs.|PHP command registration; packages; Composer; namespacing; reuse.|Teams can build custom commands for domain workflows.|
|**[[Environment Awareness]]**|Prevent destructive commands in wrong envs.|`--url`; `--path`; env flags; confirmations; read-only prod; safety wrappers.|Environment checks protect against accidental production damage.|
|**[[CLI in CI/CD Pipelines]]**|Show how WP-CLI fits into deployment automation.|Build scripts; migrations; cache flush; smoke tests; headless runs.|WP-CLI is a backbone of automated WordPress pipelines.|
|**[[Performance & Limits]]**|Discuss constraints of CLI-based workflows.|PHP memory limits; long-running tasks; SSH latency; command timeouts.|CLI is powerful but bounded by PHP and server limits.|
|**[[Common Pitfalls]]**|Identify mistakes when using WP-CLI.|Running as root; wrong path/URL; unsafe search-replace; missing packages; version mismatches.|Most WP-CLI issues arise from unsafe context or assumptions.|
