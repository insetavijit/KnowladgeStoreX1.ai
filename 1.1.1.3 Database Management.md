|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Database Management Overview**|Explain why database management is central to WordPress development.|WordPress DB role; content & settings storage; local vs remote DBs; dev/staging/prod flows.|The database stores all dynamic site data that powers WordPress.|
|**[[WordPress Database Schema]]**|Describe core tables and their purposes.|`wp_posts`, `wp_postmeta`, `wp_users`, `wp_usermeta`, `wp_options`, `wp_terms` & taxonomy tables.|Core tables model content, users, and configuration.|
|**[[Local DB Setup]]**|Explain how local databases are created and connected.|MySQL/MariaDB setup; credentials; ports; `wp-config.php` DB constants; table prefix.|Local DBs back local WordPress installs via config.|
|**[[DB Admin Tools]]**|Compare common tools used to manage WordPress DBs.|phpMyAdmin, Adminer, built-in GUIs in Local/DevKinsta; CLI via `mysql`; pros/cons.|Admin tools provide GUI/CLI access to inspect and edit data.|
|**[[SQL Dumps & Imports]]**|Show how to move databases between environments.|`mysqldump`; export/import; compression; large DB handling; charset/collation.|SQL dumps enable DB backup and migration.|
|**[[Search & Replace]]**|Explain safe URL/path updates across environments.|Serialized data; WP-CLI `search-replace`; avoiding raw SQL; dry runs.|Search/replace updates environment-specific values safely.|
|**[[Migrations & Syncing]]**|Describe structured DB movement workflows.|Push/pull; diff-based tools; staging sync; avoiding overwrites; tools like WP Migrate.|Migrations keep environments aligned without data loss.|
|**[[Backups & Versioning]]**|Emphasize data safety practices.|Scheduled backups; snapshots; offsite storage; DB-only backups; restore testing.|Backups protect against data loss during development.|
|**[[Performance Basics]]**|Discuss DB performance considerations.|Indexes; autoloaded options; query counts; slow queries; object caching.|Healthy DBs ensure fast WordPress performance.|
|**[[Security & Access Control]]**|Cover DB security fundamentals.|Strong creds; limited users; localhost binding; no root usage; SSL in prod.|Secure DB access reduces breach risk.|
|**[[Common DB Pitfalls]]**|Identify frequent mistakes and how to avoid them.|Corrupt serialized data; wrong prefixes; charset issues; overwriting prod data.|Most DB issues stem from careless edits and migrations.|
