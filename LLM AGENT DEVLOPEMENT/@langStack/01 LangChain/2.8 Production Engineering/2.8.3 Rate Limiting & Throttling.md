| **[[2.8.3 Rate Limiting & Throttling]]** | Traffic control | controlling the speed of requests to external APIs | Driving at the speed limit. |
| **[[Request Throttling]]** | Client-side limit | adding `sleep()` to ensure we don't exceed provider limits | Slowing ourselves down on purpose. |
| **[[API Rate Limits]]** | Provider rules | standard limits like "3 requests per minute" (RPM) | The rules of the road set by OpenAI or Anthropic. |
| **[[Quota Management]]** | Budgeting | tracking total usage per user/tenant to prevent abuse | ensuring one user doesn't eat the whole pie. |
| **[[Backoff]]** | Congestion control | slowing down when the server says "Too Many Requests (429)" | Backing off when the server is busy. |
| **[[Queue Management]]** | Buffering | putting requests in a queue (Celery/Redis) to process at a safe pace | A waiting line for requests. |
| **[[Limit Handling]]** | Logic | distinguishing between hard limits (stop) and soft limits (warn) | Knowing when to stop completely vs just slowing down. |
