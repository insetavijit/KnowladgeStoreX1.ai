| **[[2.10.6 Streaming Architecture]]** | Real-Time | architecture for streaming chunks of data through complex graphs | The plumbing for water, not ice cubes. |
| **[[Event Streaming]]** | Visibility | emitting `on_chain_start`, `on_llm_new_token` events | Broadcasting what is happening right now. |
| **[[Chunk Streaming]]** | Token flow | how `stream()` yields partial results from LLMs | Passing the baton token by token. |
| **[[Streaming Callbacks]]** | Reaction | reacting to stream events (e.g., updating a progress bar) | "Update the UI every time a token arrives." |
| **[[astream_events]]** | API | the standard method to subscribe to all internal chain events | The firehose of system events. |
| **[[Streaming Patterns]]** | Design | designing chains that don't block (avoiding monolithic steps) | Building pipes that don't clog. |
| **[[Stream Processing]]** | Transformation | modifying the stream on the fly (e.g., filtering bad words) | Filtering the water while it flows. |
