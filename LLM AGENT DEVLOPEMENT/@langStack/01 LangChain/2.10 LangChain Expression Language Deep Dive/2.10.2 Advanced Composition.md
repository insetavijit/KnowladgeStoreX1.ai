| **[[2.10.2 Advanced Composition]]** | Structure | building complex, non-linear workflows with LCEL | Beyond simple A -> B -> C chains. |
| **[[RunnableSequence]]** | Ordering | explicitly determining the order of operations (`First | Second`) | The standard pipe `|` chain. |
| **[[RunnableParallel]]** | Concurrency | running branches in parallel and merging results (`{a: BranchA, b: BranchB}`) | Doing two things at once. |
| **[[Nested Composition]]** | Complexity | chains within chains within chains | Matryoshka dolls of logic. |
| **[[Composition Patterns]]** | Strategy | common architectures like "Map-Reduce" or "Router" implemented in LCEL | Standard blueprints for data flow. |
| **[[Branching Logic]]** | Decision | using logic to swap distinct parts of the chain at runtime | "If X, use Chain A. If Y, use Chain B." |
| **[[Binding Args]]** | Config | `runnable.bind(stop=["\n"])` to freeze arguments | Hardcoding settings into a chain step. |
