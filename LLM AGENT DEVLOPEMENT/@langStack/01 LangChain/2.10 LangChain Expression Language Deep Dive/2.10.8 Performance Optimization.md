| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.10.8 Performance Optimization]]** | Speed | making chains run faster and cheaper | Turning the turtle into a hare. |
| **[[Batch Optimization]]** | Throughput | using `batch()` to run multiple inputs in parallel effectively | processing 10 items at once instead of 1 by 1. |
| **[[Parallel Execution]]** | Concurrency | using `RunnableParallel` to run independent steps simultaneously | Walking and chewing gum at the same time. |
| **[[Caching]]** | Efficiency | adding caching layers to runnables to avoid re-computation | "I already know the answer to this." |
| **[[Lazy Evaluation]]** | Memory | using generators and iterators to avoid loading everything into RAM | Processing data one line at a time. |
| **[[Profiling]]** | Analysis | identifying which step in the chain is the bottleneck | finding the slowpoke. |
| **[[Speed Improvements]]** | Latency | reducing overhead between chain steps (LCEL is faster than legacy chains) | Removing the friction. |
