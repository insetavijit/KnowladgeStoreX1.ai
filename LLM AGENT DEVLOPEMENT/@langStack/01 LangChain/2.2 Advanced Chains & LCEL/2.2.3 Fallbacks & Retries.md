| **[[2.2.3 Fallbacks & Retries]]** | Reliability and fault tolerance | `with_fallbacks`, `with_retry`, error handling strategies | Ensuring the chain works even when things go wrong. |
| **[[RunnableWithFallbacks]]** | Alternative execution paths | trying backup models, simplifying prompts on failure | What to do if the primary plan fails. |
| **[[Retry Logic]]** | Transitory error handling | exponential backoff, max retries, handling rate limits | Trying again automatically when a temporary error occurs. |
| **[[Error Recovery]]** | Graceful failure management | catching exceptions, returning default values, logging errors | Preventing the whole application from crashing. |
| **[[Fallback Chains]]** | Backup strategies | switching from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5, using rule-based fallbacks | A secondary chain to run when the main one breaks. |
| **[[Timeout Handling]]** | Preventing stalled requests | setting execution time limits, cancelling long processes | Stopping a process that is taking too long. |
| **[[Graceful Degradation]]** | Maintaining user experience | providing partial results, informative error messages | Failing in a way that is not catastrophic for the user. |
