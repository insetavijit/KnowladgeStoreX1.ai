| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.2.7 Batch Processing]]** | High-throughput execution | processing multiple inputs at once, `batch()` method | Running many items through the chain together efficiently. |
| **[[Batch Method]]** | The list-in/list-out API | taking list of inputs, returning list of outputs | The standard method for processing a list of items. |
| **[[Concurrent Batching]]** | Optimization strategy | `max_concurrency` config, thread pool execution | Controlling how many items execute in parallel threads. |
| **[[Batch Optimization]]** | Reducing overhead | saving connection establishment time, grouping minor tasks | Making bulk processing faster than a loop. |
| **[[Throughput]]** | System capacity measurement | requests per second, managing API rate limits | How much work the system can handle over time. |
| **[[Parallel Requests]]** | Network efficiency | keeping the network pipe full with minimal blocking | Sending many API calls at once to save time. |
| **[[Batch Error Handling]]** | Robust bulk processing | `return_exceptions=True`, partial success management | Continuing the batch even if one item fails. |
