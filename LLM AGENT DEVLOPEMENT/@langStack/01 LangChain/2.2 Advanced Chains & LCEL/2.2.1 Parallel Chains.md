| **[[2.2.1 Parallel Chains]]** | Concurrent execution of runnables | `RunnableParallel`, map-reduce patterns, fan-out/fan-in | Running multiple chain steps at the same time. |
| **[[RunnableParallel]]** | The core class for parallelism | executing dictionary of runnables, parallelizing IO-bound tasks | The LCEL primitive that runs its values in parallel. |
| **[[Parallel Execution]]** | Speeding up workflows | reducing latency, independent sub-chains, async gathering | Doing multiple things at once to save time. |
| **[[Result Merging]]** | Combining parallel outputs | dictionary output format, combining results into single context | Gathering multiple parallel results into one object. |
| **[[Fan-Out Patterns]]** | Distributing work | splitting single input to multiple independent processors | Sending one input to many workers simultaneously. |
| **[[Concurrent Processing]]** | Efficient resource usage | threading vs async, managing concurrent LLM calls | Handling multiple operations without blocking. |
| **[[Performance Optimization]]** | Reducing total latency | identifying bottlenecks, parallelizing independent steps | Making chains faster by not waiting unnecessarily. |
