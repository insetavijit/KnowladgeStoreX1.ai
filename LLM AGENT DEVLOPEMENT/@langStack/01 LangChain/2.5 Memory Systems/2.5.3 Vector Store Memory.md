| **[[2.5.3 Vector Store Memory]]** | Infinite long-term memory | storing unlimited history in vectors, retrieving relevant parts | A bottomless memory that finds relevant past details. |
| **[[VectorStoreRetrieverMemory]]** | The implementation | connecting a retriever to the memory interface | The bridge between vector DBs and agent memory. |
| **[[Semantic Memory]]** | Meaning-based recall | retrieving memories based on meaning similarity, not time | "Have we talked about this topic before?" |
| **[[Embedding-Based Retrieval]]** | Search mechanisim | converting query to vector to find relevant past turns | Using math to find relevant history. |
| **[[Long-Term Memory]]** | Beyond the session | persisting vectors to disk/cloud for cross-session recall | Remembering things forever, not just for this chat. |
| **[[Memory Search]]** | Active lookup | agent searching its own memory for facts | The agent actively checking "what do I know about X?" |
| **[[Salience Ranking]]** | Relevance scoring | determining which memories are most important to retrieve | Deciding what is important to bring up right now. |
