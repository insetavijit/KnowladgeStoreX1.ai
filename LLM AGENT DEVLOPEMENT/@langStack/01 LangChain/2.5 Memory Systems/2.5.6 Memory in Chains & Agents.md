| **[[2.5.6 Memory in Chains & Agents]]** | Integration | connecting memory classes to Runnable chains and AgentExecutors | Plugging the memory module into the thinking engine. |
| **[[Adding Memory to Chains]]** | Legacy methods | `LLMChain(memory=...)`, automatic history injection | The easy, old way to add memory to a chain. |
| **[[Memory in Agents]]** | Stateful agents | `agent_executor` memory handling, intermediate step tracking | Giving agents a short-term working memory. |
| **[[Memory Keys]]** | Variable mapping | `input_key`, `output_key`, `memory_key` configuration | Telling the memory which variables to save and load. |
| **[[Context Injection]]** | LCEL pattern | `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, modern state management | The modern way to wrap a chain with history. |
| **[[Memory Persistence]]** | Saving state | `checkpoint=...`, saving graph state in LangGraph | Ensuring the agent picks up where it left off. |
| **[[Conversation Continuity]]** | User experience | maintaining flow across multiple API calls | Making the conversation feel natural and unbroken. |
