| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.5.7 Custom Memory]]** | Extending capabilities | creating specialized memory classes for unique requirements | Building your own brain structure when standard ones don't fit. |
| **[[Memory Interface]]** | Standard contract | `save_context`, `load_memory_variables`, `clear` methods | The rules you must follow to build a compatible memory. |
| **[[save_context]]** | Input | taking `inputs` (User) and `outputs` (AI) and storing them | The function that listens to what happened. |
| **[[load_memory_variables]]** | Output | returning a dictionary of context based on current inputs | The function that speaks up with relevant memories. |
| **[[Memory Backends]]** | Flexibility | connecting custom memory to unusual databases or APIs | Wiring the brain to weird storage systems. |
| **[[Specialized Memory]]** | Domain specific | memory that remembers code, medical history, or game state | Memory optimized for a specific job. |
| **[[Subclassing BaseMemory]]** | Implementation | inheriting from `BaseChatMemory` to leverage existing logic | Don't reinvent the wheel; just modify the standard memory. |
