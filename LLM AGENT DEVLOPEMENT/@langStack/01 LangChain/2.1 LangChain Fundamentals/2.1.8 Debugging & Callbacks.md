| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.1.8 Debugging & Callbacks]]** | Observability and monitoring | inspecting chain execution, logging steps, performance tracking | Tools to see what is happening inside the exact steps of your chains. |
| **[[Callbacks System]]** | Event-driven architecture | `on_llm_start`, `on_chain_end`, hooking into lifecycle events | Execute code automatically when specific chain events occur. |
| **[[Verbose Mode]]** | Quick console debugging | `verbose=True`, printing intermediate inputs/outputs to stdout | A simple flag to print detailed logs to the console during execution. |
| **[[Tracing]]** | Visualizing execution paths | recording full trace of inputs/outputs through complex chains | Capturing the complete journey of data through a complex system. |
| **[[LangSmith Integration]]** | Production-grade monitoring | visual UI for traces, dataset testing, latency/token cost tracking | A platform for inspecting, testing, and monitoring LangChain apps. |
| **[[Debugging Chains]]** | Troubleshooting errors | `set_debug(True)`, identifying where logic breaks, inspecting state | Systematic approaches to finding errors in chain logic. |
| **[[Performance Monitoring]]** | Optimizing speed and cost | latency tracking, token usage analysis, identifying bottlenecks | keeping track of how fast and expensive your chains are running. |
