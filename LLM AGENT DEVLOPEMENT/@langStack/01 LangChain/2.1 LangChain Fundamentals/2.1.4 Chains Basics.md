| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.1.4 Chains Basics]]** | Basic orchestration & chain composition | sequential processing, input/output management, linking components | Chains sequence individual components into meaningful applications. |
| **[[LLMChain]]** | The fundamental building block | wrapper around LLM + PromptTemplate, old legacy standard, direct execution | The most basic chain linking a prompt template to an LLM. |
| **[[Sequential Chains]]** | Linking multiple chains together | `SequentialChain`, passing outputs as inputs to next step, multi-variable flows | Allows the output of one chain to be the input of the next. |
| **[[SimpleSequentialChain]]** | Linear single-input/output workflows | easier syntax, less flexibility, strictly 1-in-1-out piping | A simplified linear pipeline for single-variable chains. |
| **[[TransformChain]]** | Custom data manipulation | preprocessing inputs, python functions in chains, formatting data | Modifies inputs or generic data between chain steps. |
| **[[Chain Composition]]** | Building complex flows from blocks | modularity, reusability, combining heterogenous chains | Building complex generic flows from simpler atomic chains. |
| **[[Input/Output Keys]]** | Managing data flow and state | `input_variables`, `output_variables`, dictionary mapping | Defines precisely how data flows into and out of chains. |
| **[[Chain Invocation]]** | Executing the workflow | `invoke`, `batch`, `stream` (LCEL standards), legacy `run`/`apply` | Different methods to trigger chain execution and handle results. |
