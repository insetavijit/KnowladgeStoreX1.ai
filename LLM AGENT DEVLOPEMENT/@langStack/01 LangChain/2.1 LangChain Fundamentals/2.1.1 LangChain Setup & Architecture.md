| **[[2.1.1 LangChain Setup & Architecture]]** | Establish the foundation for LLM application development | installation, package layout, architectural principles               | LangChain provides a modular foundation for building LLM applications. |
| **[[LangChain Installation]]**               | Install and initialize the LangChain environment         | `pip install langchain`, version pinning, virtual environments       | Proper installation ensures a stable LangChain setup.                  |
| **[[Core Packages]]**                        | Understand LangChain’s internal package split            | `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, provider-specific packages  | LangChain is decomposed into focused, reusable packages.               |
| **[[Project Structure]]**                    | Organize production-ready LangChain projects             | separation of prompts, chains, tools, configs                        | Clear structure improves maintainability and scalability.              |
| **[[Modular Design]]**                       | Enable composability and flexibility                     | interchangeable components, dependency inversion, LCEL compatibility | LangChain components are designed to be composed, not hard-wired.      |
| **[[Component Ecosystem]]**                  | Leverage LangChain’s building blocks                     | models, prompts, chains, tools, retrievers, memory                   | LangChain offers a rich ecosystem of interoperable components.         |
| **[[When to Use LangChain]]**                | Decide appropriate use cases                             | orchestration complexity, multi-step reasoning, tool integration     | LangChain is best used for structured, multi-component LLM systems.    |
