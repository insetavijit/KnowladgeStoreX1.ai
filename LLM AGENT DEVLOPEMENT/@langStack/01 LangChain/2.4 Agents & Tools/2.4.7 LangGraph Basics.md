| **[[2.4.7 LangGraph Basics]]** | Cyclic graph orchestration | state machines, nodes, edges, cycles | Building agents as graphs, not just chains. |
| **[[StateGraph]]** | The container | defining the state schema (`TypedDict`) and graph structure | The blueprint for the agent's brain. |
| **[[Nodes]]** | Actions | functions that modify the state | Steps where work actually gets done (LLM call, Tool call). |
| **[[Edges]]** | Transitions | hardcoded transitions between nodes | Go from step A to step B always. |
| **[[Conditional Edges]]** | Logic | based on state, decide next node (router logic) | If "success" go to B, if "fail" go to C. |
| **[[Compiling Graphs]]** | Build step | `graph.compile()`, converting definition to runnable | Turning the blueprint into a running engine. |
| **[[Checkpointers]]** | Persistence | saving state between graph steps | Remembering where you left off in the graph. |
