| **[[2.4.1 Agent Fundamentals]]** | Autonomous reasoning | using an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take | Giving the LLM a brain to make its own plans. |
| **[[Agent Architecture]]** | The loop | Profile -> Memory -> Planning -> Action -> Observation | The standard brain structure of an autonomous agent. |
| **[[ReAct Pattern]]** | Reasoning + Acting | Reasoning about what to do, acting, then observing result | Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Repeat. |
| **[[Observation-Action Cycle]]** | Feedback loop | taking an action, reading the tool output, deciding next step | The core loop of trying something and seeing what happens. |
| **[[Tool Use]]** | Extending capabilities | giving LLMs calculators, search engines, APIs | Giving the AI hands to interact with the world. |
| **[[Prompting Strategies]]** | Guiding the agent | zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting for reliability | Instructions that tell the agent how to think. |
| **[[Agent vs Chain]]** | Hardcoded vs Dynamic | Chains are hardcoded sequences; Agents choose their own path | Chains follow a script; Agents improvise. |
