| **[[2.10.4 RunnablePassthrough Patterns]]** | Data Flow | moving inputs through a chain without changing them | The pipe that doesn't leak. |
| **[[Pass-Through Data]]** | Identity | `RunnablePassthrough()`, forwarding the input directly to the output | "Here, you hold this." |
| **[[Data Injection]]** | Context | adding extra keys to the dictionary while keeping original inputs | "Keep the user's name, but also calculate their age." |
| **[[Side Effects]]** | Logging | doing parallel tasks (like logging) without affecting the main data stream | "Write to the log file while I process this." |
| **[[Data Transformation]]** | Modification | implicitly converting inputs to expected formats in the middle of a chain | Structuring the data on the fly. |
| **[[Assign]]** | Dict Mutation | `RunnablePassthrough.assign(new_key=...)`, adding new fields to the state | "Add column 'C' which is A + B." |
| **[[Context Preservation]]** | Memory | ensuring initial user inputs survive until the end of a long chain | "Don't forget what the user asked 5 steps ago." |
