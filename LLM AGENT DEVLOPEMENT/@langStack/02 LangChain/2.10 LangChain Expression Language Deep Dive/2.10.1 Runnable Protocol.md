| **[[2.10.1 Runnable Protocol]]** | The Standard | the interface that everything in LCEL implements | The universal plug for LangChain components. |
| **[[Runnable Interface]]** | Contract | `invoke`, `stream`, `batch`, `ainvoke`, `astream`, `abatch` methods | The 6 methods every object must have. |
| **[[Input/Output Schemas]]** | Typing | `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties for strict typing | Knowing exactly what goes in and what comes out. |
| **[[Composition Primitives]]** | Building Blocks | how runnables can be coerced (e.g., dict -> RunnableParallel) | Automatic conversion of Python types into chains. |
| **[[Protocol Design]]** | Philosophy | why simplicity and composability are prioritized | "Do one thing and pipe it to the next." |
| **[[Standard Methods]]** | Uniformity | why you can `stream` a chain just like you `stream` a model | Everything behaves the same way. |
| **[[Custom Runnables]]** | Extension | implementing the interface to make your own compatible tools | Making your code plug-and-play. |
