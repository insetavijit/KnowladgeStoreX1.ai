| **[[2.9.1 Few-Shot Prompting]]** | Context learning | providing examples in the prompt to guide the model's behavior | "Here are three examples of what I want; now do the fourth one." |
| **[[FewShotPromptTemplate]]** | The class | `FewShotPromptTemplate`, the main class for constructing these prompts | The code object that stitches examples and prompt together. |
| **[[Example Formatting]]** | Structure | defining how each example looks (e.g., "Question: ... Answer: ...") | Standardizing the look of the training data. |
| **[[Optimal Number of Shots]]** | Balancing | determining if 1, 3, or 5 examples is best for the specific model | Finding the Goldilocks zone of context. |
| **[[Dynamic Examples]]** | Relevance | selecting specific examples based on the input (using Example Selectors) | "Show math examples for math questions, and history examples for history questions." |
| **[[Improves Accuracy]]** | Benefit | significantly boosting performance on complex or non-standard tasks | Teaching the model a new trick without retraining. |
| **[[Prefix and Suffix]]** | Structure | instructions before examples ("Do this:") and input after ("Now, solve:") | The bread slices around the example sandwich. |
