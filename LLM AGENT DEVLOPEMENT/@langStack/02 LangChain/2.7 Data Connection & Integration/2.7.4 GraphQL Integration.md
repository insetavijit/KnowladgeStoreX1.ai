| **[[2.7.4 GraphQL Integration]]** | Flexible querying | interacting with GraphQL APIs using natural language | Asking for exactly what you need from an API, avoiding over-fetching. |
| **[[GraphQL Chains]]** | Query construction | `GraphQAPIChain`, reading schema and generating GQL queries | An LLM writing valid GraphQL queries based on your prompt. |
| **[[Schema Understanding]]** | Introspection | parsing the `schema.graphql` to know available types/fields | Teaching the agent what data is available in the API. |
| **[[Nested Queries]]** | Deep fetching | generating queries that follow relationships (e.g., `user { posts { title } }`) | Getting related data in a single request. |
| **[[GraphQL Clients]]** | Execution | using `gql` or `requests` to send the query to the endpoint | The actual mechanism that talks to the server. |
| **[[Query Validation]]** | Syntax check | ensuring generated GQL is valid before sending | Preventing syntax errors in the query. |
| **[[Graph APIs]]** | Connectivity | connecting to GitHub, Shopify, or custom GraphQL endpoints | Integrations with modern API standards. |
