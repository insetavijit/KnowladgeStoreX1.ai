| **[[2.2.2 Routing & Branching]]** | Conditional logic in workflows | `RunnableBranch`, decision making, dynamic path selection | Directing the flow of logic based on input criteria. |
| **[[RunnableBranch]]** | The declarative if/else | list of (condition, runnable) tuples, default fallback branch | The structure that chooses which path to take. |
| **[[Conditional Routing]]** | Logic-based execution | selecting prompt based on topic, filtering inputs, guarding chains | Running different logic depending on the data. |
| **[[Dynamic Chain Selection]]** | Runtime adaptability | choosing models/tools on the fly, semantic routing | Adapting the pipeline based on the specific request. |
| **[[Route Conditions]]** | Defining the logic | boolean functions, lambda classifiers, topic classification | The rules that determine which direction to go. |
| **[[Multi-Path Workflows]]** | Complex decision trees | handling diverse user intents, specialized sub-chains | Supporting many different types of requests in one app. |
| **[[Decision Logic]]** | The "Brain" of the router | router chains, LLM-based classification, deterministic rules | The mechanism determining the correct path. |
