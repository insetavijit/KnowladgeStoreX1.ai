| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.2.6 Streaming & Async]]** | Real-time and non-blocking performance | `stream()`, `astream()`, python `asyncio`, generator functions | Getting results fast and handling many requests at once. |
| **[[Stream Method]]** | Immediate feedback | consuming chunks of output as they arrive, lower perceived latency | Seeing the first word before the last word is generated. |
| **[[Async Chains]]** | Scalability | non-blocking I/O, event loops, concurrent handling of requests | Handling 100 requests at once instead of 1 at a time. |
| **[[Token Streaming]]** | Granular output | identifying token chunks, assembling final text client-side | Processing text piece-by-piece as it comes from the LLM. |
| **[[Event Streaming]]** | Observing the process | `astream_events`, intermediate steps, tool usage events | Watching everything happening inside the chain in real-time. |
| **[[Async Generators]]** | Python mechanics | `async for`, `yield`, building async iterators for custom runnables | The Python syntax that makes streaming possible. |
| **[[Real-Time Output]]** | User experience | building typewriter effects, progress indicators, responsive UI | Making the app feel alive and fast to the user. |
