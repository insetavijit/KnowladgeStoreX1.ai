| **[[2.1.7 Memory Basics]]** | Persisting conversation state | storing interaction history, context management, statefulness | Gives chains the ability to remember past interactions. |
| **[[ConversationBufferMemory]]** | Storing full history | raw text storage, sending entire history to LLM, simple context | Stores every message raw and passes it all to the model. |
| **[[ConversationSummaryMemory]]** | Compressing history | LLM summarization of past turns, reducing token usage, maintaining gist | Summarizes the conversation over time to save tokens. |
| **[[Memory Types]]** | Various storage strategies | `BufferWindowMemory`, `EntityMemory`, `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` | Different strategies for what to keep and what to discard. |
| **[[Conversation Context]]** | Injecting history into prompts | `chat_history` variable, system messages with context, placeholder injection | How stored history is formatted and inserted into the prompt. |
| **[[History Management]]** | External persistence | `ChatMessageHistory`, database storage (SQL, Redis), saving/loading sessions | Saving conversation state to a database or file system. |
| **[[Memory in Chains]]** | Connecting state to logic | `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, automatically updating history | Integrating memory components into runnable chains. |
