| **[[2.8.1 Error Handling & Retries]]** | Resilience | recovering from API failures and model glitches | Making the app crash-proof. |
| **[[Exception Handling]]** | Try-Catch logic | wrapping LLM calls to catch `RateLimitError` or `ServiceUnavailable` | Catching errors before they crash the app. |
| **[[Retry Decorators]]** | Automatic replay | using `@retry` or `RunnableRetry` to re-attempt failed calls | "If at first you don't succeed, try again." |
| **[[Exponential Backoff]]** | Politeness | increasing wait time between retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) | Waiting longer each time so we don't spam the server. |
| **[[Fallback Strategies]]** | Plan B | `chain.with_fallbacks([backup_chain])` switching to a cheaper/dumber model on failure | Switching to GPT-3.5 when GPT-4 is down. |
| **[[Error Logging]]** | Diagnosis | recording tracebacks and inputs when things go wrong | Saving the evidence of the crash. |
| **[[Graceful Degradation]]** | UX | showing a friendly "try again later" message instead of a stack trace | Failing nicely for the user. |
