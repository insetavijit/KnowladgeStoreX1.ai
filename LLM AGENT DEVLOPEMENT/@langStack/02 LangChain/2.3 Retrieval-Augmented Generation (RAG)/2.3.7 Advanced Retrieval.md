| **[[2.3.7 Advanced Retrieval]]** | Optimizing search quality | techniques beyond simple vector search to improve accuracy | Tricks to make RAG smarter than just basic keyword matching. |
| **[[Hybrid Search]]** | Combining strengths | mixing dense vectors (semantic) + sparse vectors (keywords) | Using both understanding and keyword matching for best results. |
| **[[Re-Ranking]]** | Post-retrieval refinement | using a cross-encoder (Cohere, BGE) to score retrieved docs | Double-checking the search results with a smarter model. |
| **[[Parent Document Retrieval]]** | Context vs Precision | indexing small chunks but retrieving their larger parent docs | Finding precise matches but giving the LLM the full page to read. |
| **[[Self-Query]]** | Structured search | using an LLM to convert a question into a structured DB filter | Turning "red shoes under $50" into `color="red", price<50`. |
| **[[Compression]]** | Reducing context size | extracting only relevant logical parts of a document | Removing fluff so the LLM only sees what matters. |
| **[[Contextual Compression]]** | Query-dependent summarization | summarizing the document specifically to answer the current query | Rewriting the document on the fly to highlight the answer. |
