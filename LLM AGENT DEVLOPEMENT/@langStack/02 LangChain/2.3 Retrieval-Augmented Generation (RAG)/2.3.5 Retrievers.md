| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[2.3.5 Retrievers]]** | The interface for fetching data | abstract `get_relevant_documents` method, connecting to any source | The standard abstraction for getting documents for a query. |
| **[[VectorStoreRetriever]]** | Wrapping a vector DB | converting store to retriever, search kwargs (`k`, `score_threshold`) | Turning a database into a simple "get relevant stuff" function. |
| **[[MultiQueryRetriever]]** | Improving recall | generating nuances of user query, retrieving for all variations | Asking the question in 3 different ways to catch everything. |
| **[[ContextualCompression]]** | Reducing noise | compressing/filtering retrieved docs before returning them | Removing irrelevant parts of documents to save tokens. |
| **[[Maximum Marginal Relevance]]** | Balancing relevance and diversity | `search_type="mmr"`, avoiding duplicate/redundant info | Picking results that are relevant to the query but different from each other. |
| **[[Custom Retrievers]]** | Connecting to legacy systems | subclassing `BaseRetriever`, wrapping SQL/APIs | Making your own search engine work with LangChain. |
| **[[EnsembleRetriever]]** | Hybrid search | combining results from multiple retrievers (e.g. BM25 + Vector) | Mixing keyword search and semantic search for best results. |
