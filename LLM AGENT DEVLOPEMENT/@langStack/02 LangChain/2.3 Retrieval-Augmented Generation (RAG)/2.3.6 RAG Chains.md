| **[[RetrievalQA]]** | The basic Q&A chain | legacy chain, `chain_type="stuff"|"map_reduce"`, simple interface | The classic (but effective) way to do questions over docs. |
| **[[ConversationalRetrievalChain]]** | Chat-enabled RAG | adding history, rephrasing follow-up questions, standalone queries | RAG that remembers your previous questions. |
| **[[RAG with LCEL]]** | Modern construction | building RAG from scratch with pipes, transparency, customizable | The manual, flexible way to build RAG using modern syntax. |
| **[[Context Injection]]** | Prompt engineering for RAG | formatting retrieved docs, handling "no answer found", system prompts | How the found documents are pasted into the LLM's prompt. |
| **[[Source Citation]]** | Proving the answer | returning source documents, referencing page numbers | Showing the user exactly where the answer came from. |
| **[[RAG Patterns]]** | Standard architectures | stuff, map-reduce, refine, map-rerank | Different algorithms for processing many documents. |
