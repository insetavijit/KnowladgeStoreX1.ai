| **[[1.5.4 Inheritance]]**                      | Extend classes through inheritance hierarchies        | code reuse, polymorphism, hierarchical design                                                    | Inheritance allows classes to extend parent classes.                 |
| **[[Single Inheritance]]**                     | Inherit from one parent class                         | parent-child relationship, method inheritance, attribute inheritance                             | Single inheritance extends one parent class.                         |
| **[[super() Function]]**                       | Access parent class methods from child classes        | super() syntax, parent method calls, initialization chaining                                     | super() calls parent methods from subclasses.                        |
| **[[Method Overriding]]**                      | Replace parent methods with child implementations     | override syntax, method replacement, polymorphic behavior                                        | Method overriding replaces parent methods in child classes.          |
| **[[Multiple Inheritance]]**                   | Inherit from multiple parent classes                  | multiple parents, method resolution, complexity considerations                                   | Multiple inheritance combines multiple parent classes.               |
| **[[Method Resolution Order (MRO)]]**          | Understand method lookup order in inheritance         | MRO definition, C3 linearization, MRO() function, inheritance order                              | MRO determines method lookup order in inheritance chains.            |
| **[[Mixin Classes]]**                          | Reusable functionality through composition            | mixin pattern, role-based inheritance, behavior injection                                        | Mixins provide reusable functionality without main inheritance.      |
| **[[Inheritance vs Composition]]**             | Choose between inheritance and composition            | is-a vs has-a relationships, flexibility, coupling considerations                                | Composition often provides more flexibility than inheritance.        |
| **[[Liskov Substitution Principle]]**          | Design inheritance hierarchies correctly              | LSP definition, substitutability, inheritance contracts, design principles                       | LSP ensures subclasses are substitutable for parents.                |
