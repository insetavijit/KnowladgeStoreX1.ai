| **[[1.5.2 Instance, Class & Static Methods]]** | Understand different method types and their usage     | method categorization, appropriate use cases, method design                                      | Different method types serve different purposes in classes.          |
| **[[Instance Methods]]**                       | Methods that operate on instance data                 | instance method definition, self parameter, instance access                                      | Instance methods operate on instance state with self parameter.      |
| **[[@classmethod Decorator]]**                 | Create methods that operate on class data             | @classmethod syntax, cls parameter, class-level operations                                       | @classmethod creates methods that operate on class state with cls.   |
| **[[cls Parameter]]**                          | Access class data in class methods                    | cls represents class, cls binding, class access in methods                                       | cls parameter receives the class; Python passes it automatically.    |
| **[[@staticmethod Decorator]]**                | Create methods without instance or class access       | @staticmethod syntax, no self/cls, utility functions in classes                                  | @staticmethod creates functions that don't access instance/class.    |
| **[[When to Use Each Method Type]]**           | Choose appropriate method type for tasks              | instance methods for state, classmethods for class state, static for utilities                    | Instance/class/static methods serve different roles in design.       |
| **[[Factory Patterns with Classmethods]]**     | Use classmethods to create alternative constructors   | factory method pattern, alternative initialization, class-specific creation                      | Classmethods provide factory methods for flexible object creation.   |
| **[[Method Type Best Practices]]**             | Design methods appropriately                          | clarity, appropriate method choice, avoiding misuse, design patterns                             | Choose method types based on what data they access.                  |
