| **[[1.6.1 File Reading & Writing]]**           | Perform basic file I/O operations                     | file access, data persistence, text processing                                                   | File operations enable reading and writing data to disk.             |
| **[[open() Function]]**                        | Open files for reading and writing                    | open() syntax, file object creation, mode selection                                              | open() creates file objects for access.                              |
| **[[File Modes (r, w, a, x, b)]]**             | Specify file access modes                             | read, write, append, exclusive, binary modes, mode combinations                                  | File modes control how files are opened and accessed.                |
| **[[Reading Methods (read, readline, readlines)]]** | Read file content                                 | read() full content, readline() single line, readlines() all lines                               | Reading methods access file content in different ways.               |
| **[[Writing Methods]]**                        | Write data to files                                   | write() single write, writelines() multiple lines, write behavior                                 | Write methods output data to files.                                  |
| **[[File Objects]]**                           | Work with file handles and attributes                 | file object interface, attributes, methods, file state                                           | File objects provide interface to opened files.                      |
| **[[With Statement for Files]]**               | Use context managers for safe file handling           | with statement, automatic closing, exception safety                                              | With statement ensures proper file closure.                          |
| **[[Encoding Specification]]**                 | Handle character encoding in files                    | UTF-8, ASCII, encoding parameter, encoding errors                                                | Encoding specifies character representation in files.                |
| **[[Buffering]]**                              | Understand file buffering behavior                    | buffering modes, flush(), buffer control, performance implications                               | Buffering optimizes I/O performance.                                 |
