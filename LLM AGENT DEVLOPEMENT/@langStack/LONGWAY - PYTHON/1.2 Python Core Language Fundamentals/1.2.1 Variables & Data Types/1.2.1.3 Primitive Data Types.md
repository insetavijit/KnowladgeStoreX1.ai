| **Concept**                | **Brief (Improved, Semi-Academic)**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[int]]**                | Represents whole numbers with arbitrary precision, enabling exact arithmetic for counting, indexing, and discrete calculations.    |
| **[[float]]**              | Represents real numbers using double-precision floating-point format, suitable for approximate numerical computation.              |
| **[[str]]**                | Represents immutable sequences of Unicode characters, providing structured support for textual data processing.                    |
| **[[bool]]**               | Represents binary truth values (`True` and `False`), forming the logical foundation of control flow and decision-making.           |
| **[[Numeric Operations]]** | `int` and `float` participate in arithmetic expressions governed by Python’s numeric type hierarchy and coercion rules.            |
| **[[Type Conversion]]**    | Primitive types support explicit conversion via constructor functions, enabling controlled transformation between representations. |
| **[[Truthiness]]**         | Objects of primitive types participate in boolean contexts through well-defined truth-value testing semantics.                     |
| **[[Immutability]]**       | All primitive data types are immutable, ensuring that operations yield new objects rather than modifying existing state.           |
