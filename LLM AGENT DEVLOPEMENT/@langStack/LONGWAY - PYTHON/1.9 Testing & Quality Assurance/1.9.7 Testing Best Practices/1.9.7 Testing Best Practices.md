| **[[1.9.7 Testing Best Practices]]**           | Follow testing conventions and patterns                | code quality, maintainability, test effectiveness                                                 | Best practices improve test quality.                                 |
| **[[Test Naming Conventions]]**                | Name tests descriptively                               | test_function_scenario naming, clarity, intent communication                                      | Names describe test purpose clearly.                                 |
| **[[AAA Pattern]]**                            | Structure tests: Arrange-Act-Assert                    | setup phase, action phase, verification phase                                                     | AAA provides clear test structure.                                   |
| **[[Test Independence]]**                      | Make tests independent of each other                   | no shared state, order independence, isolation                                                    | Independence ensures tests run in any order.                         |
| **[[Test Speed]]**                             | Keep tests fast                                        | optimization, parallel execution, performance considerations                                      | Speed enables rapid test feedback.                                   |
| **[[Flaky Tests]]**                            | Eliminate non-deterministic tests                      | root causes, timing issues, flakiness detection                                                   | Flakiness indicates unreliable tests.                                |
| **[[Testing Private Methods]]**                | Strategy for testing private methods                   | through public interfaces, refactoring, accessibility                                             | Test through public interfaces when possible.                        |
| **[[Test Maintainability]]**                   | Keep tests easy to maintain                            | DRY principle, clear assertions, refactoring                                                      | Maintainability ensures long-term value.                             |
