| **[[4.7.8 Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Overview]]**| Classifying with little to no data                             | resolving cold start problems, agile taxonomy changes, cost vs accuracy                    | Learning to swim by watching a video (Zero-Shot) or trying once (Few-Shot).|
| **[[Zero-Shot Classification]]**        | No examples seen                                               | NLI-based (Entailment), label embedding matching, prompting "Is this X or Y?"              | "I've never seen a platypus, but you said it has a bill, so this must be it."|
| **[[Few-Shot Learning]]**               | N-way K-shot                                                   | Prototypical Networks, Siamese Networks, matching support set separate from query          | "Here are 3 distinct photos of a cat. Now find the cat in this pile."  |
| **[[SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning)]]**| Efficient few-shot tuning                             | Contrastive learning on sentence pairs -> classification head, highly efficient            | Training a state-of-the-art classifier with just 8 examples per class. |
| **[[In-Context Learning (ICL)]]**       | Few-shot via prompting                                         | providing examples in the prompt, no weight updates, sensitive to example order            | "Example 1: ... Example 2: ... Now you do it."                         |
| **[[Data Augmentation]]**               | Faking more data                                               | back-translation, synonym replacement, varying usage with LLMs to grow dataset             | Turning 10 examples into 1000 by paraphrasing.                         |
