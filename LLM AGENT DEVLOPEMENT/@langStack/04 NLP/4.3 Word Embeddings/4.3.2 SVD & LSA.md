| **[[4.3.2 SVD & LSA Overview]]**        | Use matrix factorization to find latent topics                 | Singular Value Decomposition, Latent Semantic Analysis, noise reduction, document indexing | LSA discovers the hidden "concepts" connecting words and documents.    |
| **[[Term-Document Matrix]]**            | Represent corpus as a count matrix                             | rows=words, cols=docs, sparse matrix, tf-idf weighting, co-occurrence capture              | The raw data from which we extract hidden semantic structures.         |
| **[[Singular Value Decomposition]]**    | Decompose matrix into three component matrices                 | U (terms), Sigma (strengths), V (docs), truncation for dimensionality reduction            | SVD compresses the matrix to reveal the most important underlying patterns.|
| **[[Dimensionality Reduction]]**        | specific concept of projecting to lower rank                   | rank-k approximation, denoising, information loss vs semantic compaction                   | Dropping the small details forces the model to learn the big picture.  |
| **[[Limitations of LSA]]**              | Why it was superseded by neural methods                        | computational cost (O(N^3)), linear linearity assumption, lack of local context            | SVD is mathematically beautiful but computationally heavy for huge vocabularies.|
| **[[Applications]]**                    | Where LSA is still relevant                                    | information retrieval, essay grading, topic clustering, small dataset analysis             | LSA is the grandfather of modern topic modeling and embeddings.        |
