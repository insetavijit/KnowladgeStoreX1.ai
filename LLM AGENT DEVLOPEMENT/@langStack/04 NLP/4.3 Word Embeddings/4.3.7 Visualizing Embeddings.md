| **[[4.3.7 Visualizing Embeddings Overview]]**| Project high-dimensional vectors to 2D/3D for inspection       | dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, visual debugging, finding patterns             | Seeing is believing: checking if "dog" clusters with "cat" or "car".   |
| **[[t-SNE]]**                           | t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding                    | non-linear, preserves local structure, perplexity parameter, computationally expensive     | The classic algorithm for making beautiful, clustered scatter plots.   |
| **[[PCA (visualization)]]**             | Principal Component Analysis for plotting                      | linear projection, preserves global structure, deterministic, faster than t-SNE            | A quick and dirty way to squash 300 dimensions flat.                   |
| **[[UMAP]]**                            | Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection                  | faster than t-SNE, better global structure preservation, scalable                          | The modern successor to t-SNE for plotting massive datasets.           |
| **[[TensorBoard Projector]]**           | Interactive visualization tool                                 | 3D rotation, search, neighbor highlighting, PCA/t-SNE/Custom switch                        | Google's tool lets you fly through your embedding space.               |
| **[[Interpreting Plots]]**              | Understanding what the clusters mean                           | identifying semantic clusters, spotting polysemy, recognizing meaningless clumps           | Don't trust the shape too much; dimensionality reduction lies.         |
