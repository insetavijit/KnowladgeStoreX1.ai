| **[[4.3.4 GloVe Overview]]**            | Global Vectors for Word Representation                         | matrix factorization + local context window, aggregating global co-occurrence counts       | GloVe combines the best of count-based (LSA) and predictive (Word2Vec) models. |
| **[[Co-occurrence Matrix]]**            | The foundation of GloVe training                               | global statistics, distinct from local windows, prob(k|i) / prob(k|j) ratio usage          | Counting how often "ice" applies to "steam" vs "solid" globally.       |
| **[[Weighting Function]]**              | Handle rare and frequent co-occurrences                        | f(x) cap at x_max, preventing common pairs from dominating loss                            | Dampening the noise of "the-and" while boosting the signal of "geology-rock". |
| **[[Objective Function]]**              | The math being minimized                                       | least squares problem, dot product equals log probability of co-occurrence                 | Making the vector math match the probability stats.                    |
| **[[GloVe vs Word2Vec]]**               | Comparison of the two giants                                   | GloVe (faster to train on counts, global stats), Word2Vec (online training, local context) | Same destination (good vectors), different vehicles (counts vs prediction).|
| **[[Pre-trained Vectors]]**             | Common usage of GloVe                                          | Wikipedia, Common Crawl, Twitter (27B, 42B, 840B tokens), 50d/100d/200d/300d               | "Just download the 6GB file and load it" is the classic GloVe workflow.|
