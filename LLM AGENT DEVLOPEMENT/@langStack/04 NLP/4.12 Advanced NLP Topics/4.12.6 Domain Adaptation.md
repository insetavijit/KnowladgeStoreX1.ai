| **[[4.12.6 Domain Adaptation Overview]]**| Moving from Source -> Target                                   | Handling distribution shift (News -> Tweets), vocabulary mismatch, style differences       | Training on Shakespeare but trying to understand Twitter.              |
| **[[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation]]**  | No labeled target data                                         | Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), aligning feature distributions                  | Forcing the model to ignore "style" features and focus on "content".   |
| **[[Adaptive Pre-training]]**           | Continued Pre-training (DAPT)                                  | Training the LM on raw text from the target domain before fine-tuning                      | Reading the medical textbook before taking the medical exam.           |
| **[[Multi-Domain Learning]]**           | One model, many domains                                        | Shared encoders, domain-specific adapters, preventing negative transfer                    | A jack of all trades who is good at Legal AND Medical.                 |
