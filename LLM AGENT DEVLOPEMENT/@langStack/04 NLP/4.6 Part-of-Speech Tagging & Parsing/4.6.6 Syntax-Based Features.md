| **[[4.6.6 Syntax-Based Features Overview]]**| Improve downstream tasks using grammatical structure           | feature extraction, tree kernels, path features, simplifying complex sentences             | Knowing *how* words connect helps you understand *what* they mean.     |
| **[[Tree Path Features]]**              | Encoding the route between two words                           | "subject-verb-object" path, distance in tree, common ancestor                              | Measuring distance not by words, but by grammatical steps.             |
| **[[Dependency Triples]]**              | (Head, Relation, Dependent) units                              | extracting (cat, nsubj, sat), (sat, prep, on), forming a knowledge graph                   | The atomic units of meaning extracted from the tree.                   |
| **[[Syntax for Sentiment]]**            | resolving scope of negation and modification                   | "not good" (negation flip), "terribly good" (intensifier), linking adjectives to targets   | Syntax tells you that "not" applies to "happy", flipping the sentiment.|
| **[[Simplification]]**                  | Breaking complex sentences into simple propositions            | clause splitting, removing appositives, active/passive conversion                          | "The dog, which was barking, ran" -> "The dog was barking. The dog ran."|
| **[[Relation Extraction]]**             | Finding facts using syntax                                     | shortest dependency path rule, matching subtrees to event schemas                          | If "CEO" and "Company" are linked by "work", extract the employment relation.|
