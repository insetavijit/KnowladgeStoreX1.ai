| **[[4.6.1 POS Tagging Basics, Overview]]**| Identify grammatic categories of words on tokens               | Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, Pronouns, Determinants                                  | Labeling the role each word plays in the sentence's grammar.           |
| **[[Penn Treebank Tags]]**              | The standard, fine-grained tagset for English                  | NNP (Proper Noun Singular), VBZ (Verb, 3rd person sing. present), JJ (Adjective)           | The 36+ tags that separate "past tense" (VBD) from "participle" (VBN). |
| **[[Universal POS Tags]]**              | A simplified, cross-lingual tagset                             | NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON, DET, ADP, NUM, PRT, INTJ, X                                    | The 17 core tags that apply to almost every language on Earth.         |
| **[[Tagging Accuracy]]**                | The high baseline of POS tagging performance                   | 97%+ accuracy is standard, ambiguous words ("run" is V/N) are the main challenge           | POS tagging is "solved" for standard text, but hard for messy data.    |
| **[[Ambiguity]]**                       | Words that can be multiple parts of speech                     | "Time flies like an arrow" (noun/verb? prep/verb?); resolving context                      | Identifying if "book" is a thing you read or an action you do.         |
| **[[POS Usage]]**                       | Why we need these tags                                         | disambiguation, feature engineering for ML, parsing, lemmatization input                   | You can't lemmatize "better" correctly if you don't know if it's an adj/adv.|
