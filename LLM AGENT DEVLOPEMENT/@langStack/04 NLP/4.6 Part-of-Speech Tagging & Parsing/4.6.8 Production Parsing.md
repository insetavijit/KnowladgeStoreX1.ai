| **[[4.6.8 Production Parsing Overview]]**| Deploying parsers in real-world apps                           | speed vs accuracy trade-off, memory footprint, batching, pruning                           | Parsing the entire internet requires a different strategy than parsing one sentence.|
| **[[SpaCy's Parser]]**                  | Fast, industrial-strength dependency parsing                   | transition-based, imitation learning, non-monotonic (allows corrections), extremely fast   | The reliable workhorse for 99% of production parsing needs.            |
| **[[Stanford CoreNLP]]**                | The academic heavyweight (Java)                                | high accuracy, constituency & dependency, requires JVM server, slower start-up             | The "old reliable" that is massive but knows everything.               |
| **[[Stanza]]**                          | Stanford's Python-native modern toolkit                        | fully neural pipeline, state-of-the-art accuracy, slower than SpaCy, better for research   | When you need accuracy more than you need raw speed.                   |
| **[[Distillation]]**                    | Making parsers smaller                                         | teacher-student training, shrinking BERT-based parsers to CPU-friendly sizes               | Compressing a giant neural parser into a tiny mobile-friendly model.   |
| **[[Caching & Pre-computation]]**       | Avoiding re-parsing                                            | storing parse trees for static corpus, hashing sentences, incremental updates              | Never parse the same Wikipedia article twice.                          |
