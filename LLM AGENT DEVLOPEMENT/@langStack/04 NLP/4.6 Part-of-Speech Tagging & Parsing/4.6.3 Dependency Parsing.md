| **[[4.6.3 Dependency Parsing Overview]]**| Analyze grammatical structure via word-to-word links           | head-dependent relationships, directed graph, root node, syntactic roles                   | Mapping who did what to whom using arrows between words.               |
| **[[Dependency Relations]]**            | The types of links between words                               | `nsubj` (nominal subject), `dobj` (direct object), `amod` (adj modifier), `det` (determiner)| Labeling the arrow: "The" is a `det` of "cat"; "cat" is `nsubj` of "sat".|
| **[[Dependency Trees]]**                | The full structural representation                             | non-projective vs projective, single head constraint, acyclic nature                       | The skeleton of the sentence's meaning.                                |
| **[[Universal Dependencies]]**          | Standardized framework for cross-lingual parsing               | consistent annotation scheme across 100+ languages, facilitating multilingual models       | Ensuring "subject" means the same thing in English, Hindi, and Finnish.|
| **[[Typed Dependencies]]**              | Specific grammatical labels                                    | separating `nsubj:pass` (passive subject) from `nsubj` (active), enhancing semantic utility| Fine-grained labels that tell you if the cat chased or was chased.     |
| **[[Parsing Algorithms]]**              | How to build the tree                                          | transition-based (shift-reduce), graph-based (maximum spanning tree), neural parsing       | The logic that draws the arrows correctly.                             |
