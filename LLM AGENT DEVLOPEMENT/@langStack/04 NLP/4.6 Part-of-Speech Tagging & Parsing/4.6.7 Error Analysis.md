| **[[4.6.7 Error Analysis Overview]]**   | Understanding where and why parsers fail                       | ambiguity, attachment errors, coordination scope, OOV words                                | Diagnosing why the robot thinks "time flies like an arrow" is a simile about insects.|
| **[[PP Attachment]]**                   | Prepositional Phrase attachment ambiguity                      | "I saw the man with the telescope" (who has it?), heuristic resolution                     | The classic "Who is holding the telescope?" problem.                   |
| **[[Coordination Scope]]**              | Ambiguity in "and/or" lists                                    | "old men and women" (old men + all women? or old [men+women]?), Oxford comma impact        | Deciding if the adjective applies to the whole list or just the first item.|
| **[[Garden Path Sentences]]**           | Sentences that lead the parser down a dead end                 | "The horse raced past the barn fell", structural reanalysis requirement                    | Sentences that trick you into building the wrong tree until the very last word.|

| **[[Evaluation Metrics]]**              | Measuring parse quality                                        | UAS (Unlabeled Attachment Score), LAS (Labeled Attachment Score), exact match              | UAS: "Did I draw the arrow to the right word?"; LAS: "...and label it correctly?".|
