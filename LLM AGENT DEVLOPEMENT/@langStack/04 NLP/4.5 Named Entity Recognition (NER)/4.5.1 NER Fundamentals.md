| **[[4.5.1 NER Fundamentals Overview]]** | Identify and classify real-world objects in text               | named entities, information extraction, structured data, unstructured to structured        | "Apple" is an Organization, not a Fruit.                               |
| **[[Entity Types]]**                    | The standard categories we look for                            | PER (Person), ORG (Organization), LOC (Location), GPE (Geopolitical Entity), DATE, MONEY   | The "Who, What, Where, When" of the text.                              |
| **[[IOB Tagging]]**                     | Inside-Outside-Beginning scheme                                | B-PER (Begin Person), I-PER (Inside Person), O (Outside), standardizing span labeling      | Telling the model where "New" starts and "York" ends in "New York".    |
| **[[BILOU Scheme]]**                    | Enhanced tagging scheme                                        | Begin, Inside, Last, Unit (Single), Outside; more expressive than IOB                      | Distinguishing single-word entities ("Paris") from multi-word tails ("City").|
| **[[Entity Boundaries]]**               | Defining where an entity starts and stops                      | token-level classification, span detection, handling punctuation overlap                   | Precision matters: "George Washington's" -> is the "'s" part of the name?|
| **[[Nested Entities]]**                 | Handling entities inside other entities                        | "The [University of [Texas]]"; flat NER vs nested NER challenges                           | Dealing with the Russian dolls of language structure.                  |
