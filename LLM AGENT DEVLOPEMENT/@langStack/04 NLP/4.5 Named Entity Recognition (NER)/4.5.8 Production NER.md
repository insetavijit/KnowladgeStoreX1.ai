| **[[4.5.8 Production NER Overview]]**   | Moving from accuracy to reliability and speed                  | latency, throughput, model size, confidence scores, standardizing outputs                  | A production model needs to be fast, robust, and handle garbage input. |
| **[[SpaCy NER]]**                       | The industry workhorse for CPU-based NER                       | speed-optimized Cython components, pre-trained pipelines (`en_core_web_trf`), ease of use  | If you need it running on a CPU today, you use SpaCy.                  |
| **[[HuggingFace NER]]**                 | The research standard for accuracy                             | `distilbert-ner`, `roberta-ner`, pipeline usage, GPU acceleration, high accuracy           | If accuracy is paramount and you have GPUs, you use Transformers.      |
| **[[Confidence Thresholding]]**         | Knowing when to be silent                                      | filtering low-probability entities, precision-recall trade-off at valid time               | It's better to say nothing than to confidently say something wrong.    |
| **[[Error Handling]]**                  | Managing unexpected inputs                                     | excessively long text, emojis, mixed languages, format cleaning                            | Pre-processing steps that prevent the model from crashing on weird text.|
| **[[Post-Processing]]**                 | Cleaning up model outputs                                      | merging fragmentation, enforcing business logic, filtering stop-word entities              | Fixing the little mistakes the model makes (like tagging "The" as a name).|
