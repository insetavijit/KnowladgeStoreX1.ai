| **[[4.1.5 Stemming & Lemmatization Overview]]**| Reduce words to their root forms                               | morphological normalization, vocabulary reduction, feature density, recall enhancement     | Stemming chops ends; Lemmatization finds the dictionary root.          |
| **[[Stemming Algorithms]]**             | Apply heuristic rules to chop word endings                     | Porter (conservative), Lancaster (aggressive), Snowball (improved Porter), language rules  | Stemmers are fast, crude tools that often produce non-words ("runn" vs "running"). |
| **[[Lemmatization]]**                   | Transform words to their canonical dictionary form             | morphological analysis, part-of-speech context, WordNet, dictionary lookups                | Lemmatization allows "better" -> "good", preserving semantic meaning.  |
| **[[Over-stemming vs Under-stemming]]** | Balance aggressiveness of reduction                            | false positives (universe/university), false negatives (alumni/alumnus), precision trade-offs | Aggressive stemming conflates distinct meanings; weak stemming misses connections. |
| **[[When to Use Which]]**               | Choose the right technique for the task                        | IR/Search (Stemming often sufficient), Text Gen/QA (Lemmatization required), speed vs accuracy| Use stemming for speed and broad recall; use lemmatization for precision. |
| **[[Morphological Analysis]]**          | understand internal structure of words                         | morphemes, affixes, roots, stems, agglutinative languages, compound splitting              | Morphology is the deeper linguistic structure that stemming approximates. |
