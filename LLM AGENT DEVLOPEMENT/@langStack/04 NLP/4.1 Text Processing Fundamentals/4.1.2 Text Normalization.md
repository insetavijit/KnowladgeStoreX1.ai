| **[[4.1.2 Text Normalization Overview]]**| Unify text representation for consistent processing            | reduction of vocabulary size, semantic equivalence, canonical forms, pre-retrieval cleanup | Normalization ensures that "Text", "text", and "TEXT" are treated consistently. |
| **[[Lowercasing]]**                     | Convert all characters to lowercase                            | `lower()` logic, distinct from case folding, irreversible loss of case information         | Lowercasing is the simplest baseline for vocabulary reduction.         |
| **[[Case Folding]]**                    | Aggressively normalize case for comparison (beyond ASCII)      | handling `ß` to `ss`, Turkish `i` point variations, locale-independent matching            | Case folding resolves complex casing issues in multilingual text.      |
| **[[Unicode Normalization]]**           | Standardize binary representation of characters                | NFC (Composition), NFD (Decomposition), NFKC, canonical equivalence, visual equivalence    | Unicode normalization prevents identical-looking text from having different modification bytes. |
| **[[Accent Removal]]**                  | Strip diacritics and accents (ASCII Folding)                   | mapping `é` to `e`, `ñ` to `n`, preserving base characters, search vs. display requirements | Removing accents simplifies text matching at the cost of phonetic nuance. |
| **[[Text Standardization]]**            | Map variations to a single canonical form                      | expansion of abbreviations (US -> United States), date formatting, number standardization  | Standardization resolves ambiguity by enforcing a single format.       |
| **[[Consistency Handling]]**            | Ensure uniform rules across the entire dataset                 | pipeline reproducibility, handling mixed encoding, deterministic processing                | Consistency prevents downstream errors caused by format mismatches.    |
