| **[[4.1.6 Regular Expressions Overview]]**| Define patterns for complex text matching                      | pattern recognition, extraction, substitution, validation, formal language theory          | Regex is the Swiss Army knife for string search and manipulation.      |
| **[[Regex Syntax]]**                    | Master the metacharacters and constructs                       | `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `[]`, `()`, `|`, anchors (`^`, `$`), quantifying repetition             | Syntax mastery transforms raw strings into identifiable patterns.      |
| **[[Pattern Matching]]**                | Find specific sequences within text                            | literal matches, character classes, greedy vs lazy matching, lookaheads/lookbehinds        | Matching allows you to pinpoint needles in textual haystacks.          |
| **[[Text Extraction]]**                 | Pull structured data from unstructured text                    | capturing groups, named groups, `findall()` vs `match()`, extracting emails/phones         | Extraction converts "Call me at 555-0199" into `{phone: "555-0199"}`.  |
| **[[Regex for NLP]]**                   | Apply regex to common linguistic tasks                         | tokenization patterns, finding entities, cleaning punctuation, custom splitters            | Regex bridges the gap between raw text and structured NLP features.    |
| **[[Regex Optimization]]**              | Improve performance of complex patterns                        | backtracking issues, catastrophic backtracking, atomic groups, compiling patterns          | A poorly written regex can hang your entire processing pipeline.       |
