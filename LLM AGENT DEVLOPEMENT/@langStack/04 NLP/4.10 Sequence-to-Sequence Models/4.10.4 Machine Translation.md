| **[[NMT Architectures]]**               | The engines of translation                                     | LSTM-based NMT, Transformer-based NMT (SOTA), competitive with human parity on some pairs  | The machine that reads Spanish and writes English.                     |
| **[[Multilingual Models]]**             | Many-to-Many translation                                       | Single model for 100+ languages, Zero-Shot Translation (translating pairs never seen together)| A polyglot that can translate Swahili to Korean via English representation.|
| **[[Back-Translation]]**                | Data augmentation technique                                    | Training Target->Source model to generate synthetic source data from monolingual target text| turning a French book into broken English to teach the English->French model.|
