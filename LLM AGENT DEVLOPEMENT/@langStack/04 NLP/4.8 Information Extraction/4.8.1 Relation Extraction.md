| **[[4.8.1 Relation Extraction Overview]]**| Identifying relationships between entities                     | Binary relations (Subject-Predicate-Object), relation classification, distant supervision  | Connecting the dots: "Steve Jobs" --(founded)--> "Apple".              |
| **[[Supervised Extraction]]**           | Training on labeled data                                       | Feature-based methods, kernel methods, neural relation extraction (BERT-based)             | Teaching the model exactly what "married to" looks like.               |
| **[[Distant Supervision]]**             | Using knowledge bases to label text                            | "If KB says X and Y are related, assume any sentence with X and Y expresses that relation" | Assuming that if two people are married, any sentence mentioning both involves marriage.|
| **[[Joint Entity-Relation Extraction]]**| Finding entities and relations at once                         | End-to-end models, avoiding error propagation from NER to RE, table filling                | Doing the whole puzzle at once instead of finding edge pieces first.   |
| **[[Document-Level RE]]**               | Relations across sentences                                     | Co-reference awareness, graph neural networks for document context                         | Realizing that "He" in sentence 2 refers to "Obama" in sentence 1.     |
| **[[Few-Shot Relation Extraction]]**    | Learning new relations with few examples                       | Prototypical networks, meta-learning, adapting to new schemas                              | Learning to spot "invested in" after seeing just 3 examples.           |
