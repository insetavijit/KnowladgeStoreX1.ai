| **[[4.8.5 Open Information Extraction Overview]]**| Extracting relations without a pre-defined schema              | (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples, schema-agnostic, discovering new knowledge           | Learning *whatever* the text says, not just what you were looking for. |
| **[[ClausIE / OpenIE]]**                | Rule-based open extraction                                     | Dependency parsing patterns, clause splitting, extracting logic from sentence structure    | Using grammar rules to turn "Cats eat mice" into `(Cats, eat, mice)`.  |
| **[[Triple Extraction]]**               | The core unit of KG                                            | Entity-Relation-Entity, handling n-ary relations (Subject, Predicate, Object, Time)        | Converting sentences into graph edges.                                 |
| **[[Relation Discovery]]**              | Clustering similar relations                                   | "founded", "started", "established" -> `org:founded_by`, generalizing predicates           | Realizing that "wrote" and "authored" mean the same thing.             |
| **[[Neural OpenIE]]**                   | Seq2Seq approaches                                             | Generating structured tuples from text, handling implicit relations                        | Using a transformer to translate English into Database Rows.           |
| **[[Confidence Scoring]]**              | Filtering bad extractions                                      | Probability of validity, removing "garbage" triples like `(It, is, raining)`               | Throwing out the junk so the Knowledge Graph stays clean.              |
