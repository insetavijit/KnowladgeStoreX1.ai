| **[[4.8.8 Evaluation & Metrics Overview]]**| Measuring extraction quality                                   | Precision, Recall, F1-Score, strict vs lenient matching                                    | Scoring the exam.                                                      |
| **[[Strict vs Lenient Matching]]**      | How precise the span needs to be                               | Exact match ("Barack Obama" vs "Obama"), partial credit for overlapping spans              | Do you get points if you missed the middle initial?                    |
| **[[Macro vs Micro Averaging]]**        | Handling class imbalance                                       | Micro (global count), Macro (average per class), important for rare relation types         | Treating the rare "Spouse" relation as equally important as the common "BornIn".|
| **[[Confusion Matrix]]**                | Analyzing error types                                          | False Positives (hallucinated relations), False Negatives (missed relations)               | Seeing if the model is hallucinating or just blind.                    |
| **[[Human Evaluation]]**                | The gold standard                                              | Inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's Kappa), evaluating usefulness over raw metrics          | asking a human "Is this actually correct?"                             |
| **[[End-to-End Evaluation]]**           | Testing the whole pipeline                                     | Analyzing errors propagating from NER to Relation Extraction                               | Checking if the house fell down because the foundation (NER) was weak. |
