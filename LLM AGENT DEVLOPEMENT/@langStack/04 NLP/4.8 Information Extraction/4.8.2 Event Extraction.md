| **[[4.8.2 Event Extraction Overview]]** | Identifying real-world events in text                          | Event triggers, event arguments (who, when, where), event schemas (ACE, ERE)               | Turning a news story into a structured "Who did what to whom" report.  |
| **[[Trigger Detection]]**               | Finding the word that signifies the event                      | "Attack", "Acquired", "Born", multi-class classification problem                           | Spotting the verb that kicks off the action.                           |
| **[[Argument Extraction]]**             | Filling the roles                                              | Agent, Patient, Time, Location, instrument, mapping entities to event roles                | Figuring out that "Bob" is the Attacker and "Alice" is the Victim.     |
| **[[Event Coreference]]**               | Linking mentions of the same event                             | "The explosion" vs "The blast", resolving cross-document event identity                    | Realizing the morning news and evening news are talking about the same fire.|
| **[[Script Learning]]**                 | Learning typical event sequences                               | "Eat at restaurant" -> [Enter, Order, Eat, Pay, Leave], narrative schemas                  | Knowing that if someone "ordered", they probably "ate" and "paid" too. |
| **[[Open Domain Event Extraction]]**    | Discovering new event types                                    | Bayesian non-parametric models, clustering triggers, schema-free extraction                | Finding events we didn't train for, like "Cyber-bullying" or "Meme-ing".|
