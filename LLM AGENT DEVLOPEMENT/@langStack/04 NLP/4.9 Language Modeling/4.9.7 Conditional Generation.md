| **[[4.9.7 Conditional Generation Overview]]**| Generating text based on input X                               | P(Y | X), Translation, Summarization, QA, instead of just P(Y)                                   | Writing a reply, not just babbling randomly.                           |
| **[[Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq)]]**       | The architecture of conditioning                               | Encoding X into a vector, decoding Y from that vector, bottleneck problem                  | Reading the email (Encode) before writing the reply (Decode).          |
