# 1.5.4 Sliding Window Techniques

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.5.4.1 FIFO Buffer]]** | Basic Memory | First-In-First-Out, queue management, simplistic pruning | The simplest method: when the buffer is full, delete the oldest message to make room for the new one. |
| **[[1.5.4.2 Overlap Strategies]]** | Continuity | Rolling overlap, context bridging, smooth transitions | Keeping a "bridge" of content between chunks prevents context from being severed at the cut point. |
| **[[1.5.4.3 Dialogue History Truncation]]** | Chat management | Limiting "Last N turns", pruning remote history | In chat, the last 5 turns are usually more relevant than turn #1; prioritize recent interaction. |
| **[[1.5.4.4 Fixed vs Dynamic Windows]]** | Flexibility | Hard token limit vs adaptive sizing | Fixed windows are easier to code; dynamic windows (resizing based on content importance) are smarter. |
| **[[1.5.4.5 Window Management Algorithms]]** | Logic | Least-Recently-Used (LRU), Semantic retention | Algorithms that decide *what* to drop based on usage frequency or semantic value, not just time. |
| **[[1.5.4.6 Maintaining "Pinned" Context]]** | Hybrid approach | Static system instructions + Sliding history | Always keep the system instructions (Pinned) at the top, while sliding the user history below it. |
| **[[1.5.4.7 Loss of Continuity]]** | Pitfalls | Forgetting definitions, broken references, "Who is he?" | One danger of sliding windows is referencing an entity that just slid out of the memory. |
| **[[1.5.4.8 Recursive Windows]]** | Synthesis | Summarizing key points before sliding out | Before a chunk slides out, summarize its key facts and append them to the "permanent" memory. |
| **[[1.5.4.9 Rolling Summaries]]** | Accumulation | "Current state" summary, updating per turn | Maintaining a constantly updated summary of the conversation state alongside the raw recent text. |
| **[[1.5.4.10 Implementation in LangChain]]** | Tooling | `ConversationBufferMemory`, `ConversationSummaryMemory` | Leveraging existing libraries simplifies the complex logic of window management. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Sliding Window Techniques**, managing the flow of time in limited memory.
