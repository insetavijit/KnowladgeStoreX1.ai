# 1.5.8 Context Packing

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.5.8.1 Formatting Removal]]** | Stripping | Removing markdown bolding `**`, headers, excessive spaces | Removing visual formatting that doesn't add semantic value can save 5-10% of overhead. |
| **[[1.5.8.2 Shortened Delimiters]]** | Syntax efficiency | Using `|` instead of `Question:`, single char tokens | Using short, single-token delimiters instead of verbose labels saves space in few-shot examples. |
| **[[1.5.8.3 Acronym Standardization]]** | Compression | Defining "US" for "United States", local definitions | Defining strict acronyms at the start allows using short forms throughout the rest of the prompt. |
| **[[1.5.8.4 Data Serialization (JSON vs CSV)]]** | Format choice | CSV token efficiency vs JSON readability | CSV is significantly more token-efficient than JSON (no repeated keys) for tabular data. |
| **[[1.5.8.5 Implicit Context]]** | Pruning | Removing "As you know...", minimizing politeness | Removing polite preambles and assumed knowledge keeps the prompt dense and focused. |
| **[[1.5.8.6 Packing Multiple Documents]]** | Batching | `Doc 1: ... Doc 2: ...`, distinct separators | Safely putting multiple documents into one prompt requires robust separators to preventing bleeding. |
| **[[1.5.8.7 Instruction Placement]]** | Ordering | "Instructions last", sandwich method | In a packed context, placing instructions at the *end* (or both ends) prevents them from being lost in the middle. |
| **[[1.5.8.8 Whitespace Reduction]]** | Minification | Removing double spaces, trimming newlines | Aggressive whitespace removal (minification) is useful for code, less so for prose (can hurt reasoning). |
| **[[1.5.8.9 System Message Optimization]]** | Persistent storage | Keeping the system prompt lean, moving data to user | The system prompt is re-sent every turn; keeping it small minimizes the recurring cost of chat. |
| **[[1.5.8.10 Batch Processing]]** | Thoughput | Asking 5 questions in 1 prompt (Map) | Packing multiple unrelated short questions into a single API call saves network overhead and input costs. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Context Packing**, maximizing the value of every single token.
