# 1.5.2 Information Prioritization

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.5.2.1 Relevance Ranking]]** | Filtering | Scoring inputs, TF-IDF, semantic similarity | Not all data is equal; algorithmically ranking what matters most ensures the best use of the window. |
| **[[1.5.2.2 The "Need to Know" Principle]]** | Minimalism | Minimal viable context, removing fluff | Only provide the model with the exact information required to answer the specific query at hand. |
| **[[1.5.2.3 Dynamic Context Selection]]** | Runtime logic | Selecting tools/docs based on query type | Different questions require different context sets; don't load the whole manual for a "hello". |
| **[[1.5.2.4 Pruning Redundancy]]** | Cleanup | De-duplication, merging similar chunks | Removing repeated information frees up space without losing semantic value. |
| **[[1.5.2.5 Primacy & Recency Effects]]** | Bias management | Beginning/End weighting, "Lost in the middle" | placing critical instructions at the start and end of the prompt ensures better adherence. |
| **[[1.5.2.6 User Query Dependency]]** | Alignment | Embedding distance, query expansion | The user's specific question determines which parts of the available data are "high priority." |
| **[[1.5.2.7 Attention Mechanism Basics]]** | Theory | Soft attention, self-attention, masking | Understanding how the model "pays attention" helps explains why flooding clarity works better than broad context. |
| **[[1.5.2.8 Hierarchical Importance]]** | Structuring | Summaries first, details on demand, headlines | Structuring context hierarchically allows the model to grasp the big picture before diving into details. |
| **[[1.5.2.9 Semantic Filtering]]** | Meaning-based | "Filter out off-topic paragraphs" | Using a cheaper model (or embedding) to filter out irrelevant paragraphs before the primary model sees them. |
| **[[1.5.2.10 Manual Curation]]** | Human-in-the-loop | Hard-coded priority lists, pinned items | Sometimes, explicit human rules ("Always include pricing table") override algorithmic ranking. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Information Prioritization**, ensuring the model focuses on the signal, not the noise.
