# 1.5.6 Summarization in Context

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.5.6.1 Recursive Summarization]]** | Long docs | "Summarize chunks, then summarize the summaries", tree structure | Recursively collapsing a book into chapters, then chapters into a page, allows processing infinite length. |
| **[[1.5.6.2 Chain of Density]]** | Information preservation | "Add 5 missing entities", iterative densification | A prompting technique that forces the model to rewrite the summary multiple times, adding more facts each time. |
| **[[1.5.6.3 Entity-Centric Summaries]]** | Specificity | "Summarize the actions of Person X", focus tracking | Summarizing a text specifically from the perspective of one character or entity ignores irrelevant noise. |
| **[[1.5.6.4 Map-Reduce Summarization]]** | Parallelism | Map (summarize each part), Reduce (combine results) | running summarization on 100 chunks in parallel, then combining them, handles massive datasets fast. |
| **[[1.5.6.5 Refine (Iterative) Summarization]]** | Quality | "Update summary with new info", sequential improvement | Reading through a document and constantly updating a running summary (slower but more coherent). |
| **[[1.5.6.6 Aspect-Based Summarization]]** | Filtering | "Summarize only the financial risks", targeted extraction | Focusing the summary on specific aspects (e.g., risks, dates, costs) rather than a general overview. |
| **[[1.5.6.7 Maintaining Semantic Integrity]]** | Evaluation | Fact preservation, hallucination check, critical info loss | Ensuring the summary didn't lose the "not" in "do not press the button" is a critical safety check. |
| **[[1.5.6.8 Summarizing Code]]** | Technical | Docstring generation, logic abstraction, identifying I/O | Summarizing code requires explaining the *intent* and *interface*, not just shortening the syntax. |
| **[[1.5.6.9 Bullet vs Narrative]]** | Structuring | Scannability vs flow, "5 key points", executive brief | Choosing the right output structure (bullets for speed, paragraphs for context) changes the utility. |
| **[[1.5.6.10 Summary Update Triggers]]** | Automation | "When to summarize?", token thresholds, topic shifts | Knowing *when* to trigger a summary (e.g., when the token buffer is 80% full) is an engineering challenge. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Summarization**, the primary tool for compressing intelligence.
