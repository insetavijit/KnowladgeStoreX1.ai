# 1.6.5 Counterfactual Thinking

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.5.1 "What If" Scenarios]]** | Imagination | Exploration, conditional generation, scenario planning | The ability to imagine a world that *does not exist* is the core of rigorous planning and testing. |
| **[[1.6.5.2 Altering History]]** | Analysis | "If the Nazis won...", historical divergence, impact assessment | Changing one past variable to see how the future unfolds helps understand the weight of that variable. |
| **[[1.6.5.3 Variable Isolation]]** | Science | Controlling variables, ceteris paribus, A/B testing | To understand the effect of X, we must imagine a world where only X is different. |
| **[[1.6.5.4 Hypothetical Outcomes]]** | Prediction | Simulation, "Fast forward", consequence mapping | Projecting current decisions into future hypothetical states prevents shortsightedness. |
| **[[1.6.5.5 Impact Analysis]]** | Decision support | Pre-mortem, risk assessment, "What could go wrong?" | Imagining failure *before* it happens allows us to build prevention mechanisms. |
| **[[1.6.5.6 Inverting Assumptions]]** | Creativity | "What if the opposite were true?", negation, flipping | Challenging core assumptions by treating their opposites as true often reveals hidden innovations. |
| **[[1.6.5.7 Sensitivity Analysis]]** | Robustness | "If interest rates rose 1%...", stress testing | Testing how much the outcome changes when input variables wiggle slightly. |
| **[[1.6.5.8 Alternate Timelines]]** | Narrative | Multiverse storytelling, branching paths, choice consequence | In creative writing, managing multiple potential plot lines requires counterfactual consistency. |
| **[[1.6.5.9 Regret Minimization]]** | Ethics | "Which choice will I regret least?", future-self perspective | Evaluating decisions based on hypothetical future emotional states. |
| **[[1.6.5.10 Future Casting]]** | Strategy | Backcasting, "Imagine it is 2030", strategic vision | Standing in a hypothetical future and looking *back* to see how we got there. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Counterfactual Thinking**, the simulator in the mind.
