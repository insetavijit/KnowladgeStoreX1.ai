# 1.6.2 Mathematical Reasoning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.2.1 Word Problem Translation]]** | Modeling | Extracting variables, defining equations from text | The hardest part of math is often translating unstructured words into structured formulas. |
| **[[1.6.2.2 Step-by-Step Execution]]** | Process rigor | "Show your work", sequential logic, COT | Forcing the model to write out each calculation step drastically reduces arithmetic errors. |
| **[[1.6.2.3 Formula Retrieval]]** | Knowledge access | Identifying correct theorems, looking up constants | "Use the quadratic formula" is a necessary prompt when the model doesn't intuitively know which tool to pick. |
| **[[1.6.2.4 Unit Conversion Consistency]]** | Dimensional analysis | Dimensional homogeneity, explicit conversion steps | Ensuring apples are compared to apples (and meters to meters) prevents catastrophic engineering failures. |
| **[[1.6.2.5 Self-Verification of Math]]** | Checking | Reverse calculation, estimation, sanity check | "Roughly estimate the answer first" helps the model catch order-of-magnitude hallucinations. |
| **[[1.6.2.6 Symbolic Reasoning]]** | Algebra | Manipulating variables, keeping X as X, derivation | LLMs can do algebra (symbol manipulation) often better than they can do arithmetic (calculation). |
| **[[1.6.2.7 Handling Large Numbers]]** | Precision limits | Tokenization issues, comma separation, scientific notation | LLMs struggle with large integers due to tokenization; using scientific notation often helps. |
| **[[1.6.2.8 Code-Assisted Math (PAL)]]** | Tool use | Writing Python to calculate, "Program Aided Language" | The gold standard: don't ask the LLM to calculate; ask it to write Python code that calculates. |
| **[[1.6.2.9 Logic vs Intuition]]** | Cognitive mode | Overriding "fast" intuition with "slow" calculation | Math requires suppressing the probabilistic "next token" instinct in favor of rigid logical rules. |
| **[[1.6.2.10 Error Diagnosis]]** | Debugging | Finding the sign error, re-evaluating assumptions | When the answer is wrong, finding *where* the logic broke is a distinct skill. |
