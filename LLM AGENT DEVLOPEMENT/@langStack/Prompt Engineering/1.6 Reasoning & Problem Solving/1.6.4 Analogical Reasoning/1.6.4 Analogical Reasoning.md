# 1.6.4 Analogical Reasoning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.4.1 Source-Target Mapping]]** | Core mechanic | Mapping features from known (source) to unknown (target) | "An atom is like a solar system" works by mapping nucleus->sun and electron->planet. |
| **[[1.6.4.2 Structure Mapping Theory]]** | Psychology | Relational matching, ignoring surface features | Good analogies match the *relationship structure*, not the superficial attributes (color, size). |
| **[[1.6.4.3 Generating Analogies]]** | Creativity | "Explain X using an analogy of Y", metaphors | Asking the model to invent an analogy helps explain complex topics to users. |
| **[[1.6.4.4 Evaluating Analogies]]** | Critical thinking | "Where does this analogy break down?", limits | All analogies are imperfect; identifying *why* is key to deeper understanding. |
| **[[1.6.4.5 Cross-Domain Transfer]]** | Innovation | Applying biology solutions to engineering problems | Biomimicry is the ultimate example of cross-domain analogical reasoning. |
| **[[1.6.4.6 Metaphorical Thinking]]** | Abstraction | "War on drugs", "Liquid assets", conceptual framing | Metaphors shape how we think about a problem; controlling them controls the frame. |
| **[[1.6.4.7 Abstract Pattern Matching]]** | IQ test style | "A is to B as C is to ?", finding relations | Solving formal analogy problems requires detecting the abstract transformation rule. |
| **[[1.6.4.8 Case-Based Reasoning]]** | Law/Medicine | Precedent, "This is like the case of 1994" | solving new problems by retrieving and adapting solutions from similar past cases. |
| **[[1.6.4.9 Explanation via Analogy]]** | Pedagogy | Bridging the gap, "It's like...", familiarisation | The best way to teach a new concept is to anchor it to something the user already knows. |
| **[[1.6.4.10 Limits of Analogy]]** | Safety | False equivalence, over-extension, bias | Warning: Reasoning ONLY by analogy can lead to major errors when the mapping is weak. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Analogical Reasoning**, using the known to navigate the unknown.
