# 1.6.7 Multi-Hop Reasoning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.7.1 Bridging Entities]]** | Connection | The link, the middleman, common term | Finding the entity that connects two seemingly unrelated facts (Fact A -> Link -> Fact B). |
| **[[1.6.7.2 Transitive Relations]]** | Math/Logic | A > B, B > C, therefore A > C | Applying transitive properties across a chain of comparisons to rank items. |
| **[[1.6.7.3 Information Synthesis]]** | Merging | Combining distinct documents, unified answer | Taking Fact A from Document 1 and Fact B from Document 2 to answer a question neither solves alone. |
| **[[1.6.7.4 Step-by-Step Retrieval]]** | Search strategy | "Find X, then use X to find Y", serial search | Recognizing that you cannot search for the answer until you first search for the question's parameters. |
| **[[1.6.7.5 Graph Traversal]]** | Navigation | Knowledge graphs, hopping nodes, degrees of separation | Moving through a network of concepts to find the path from start to finish. |
| **[[1.6.7.6 Intermediate Conclusions]]** | Checkpoints | Partial answers, holding state | Storing the result of Hop 1 ("The capital is Paris") to use in Hop 2 ("What river flows through Paris?"). |
| **[[1.6.7.7 Explicit Reasoning Paths]]** | Transparency | "Show the chain", audit trail | Forcing the model to output the full path of hops makes the final answer verifiable. |
| **[[1.6.7.8 Handling Disconnected Facts]]** | Failure mode | "No link found", gap identification | Identifying when a chain *cannot* be completed is just as important as completing it. |
| **[[1.6.7.9 Inference Aggregation]]** | Evidence | multiple clues pointing to one conclusion | Sherlock Holmes style reasoning: 5 small, unrelated clues add up to one suspect. |
| **[[1.6.7.10 "HotpotQA" Style Strategies]]** | Benchmarks | Decomposition, re-ranking, bridge retrieval | Specific techniques developed to solve multi-hop QA benchmarks like HotpotQA. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Multi-Hop Reasoning**, connecting the dots across the universe of data.
