# 1.6.6 Causal Reasoning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.6.1 Cause and Effect Chains]]** | Sequence | Dominos, ripple effects, temporal order | Identifying that A happened, which *caused* B, which *caused* C, is distinct from just listing events. |
| **[[1.6.6.2 Correlation vs Causation]]** | Fallacy check | Spurious correlations, "Ice cream causes shark attacks" | The most common logical error; explicit training is needed to prevent models from conflating the two. |
| **[[1.6.6.3 Identifying Confounders]]** | Rigor | Hidden variables, third-factor problems | Asking "What else could have caused this?" reveals the hidden variable Z that causes both X and Y. |
| **[[1.6.6.4 Root Cause Analysis]]** | Debugging | 5 Whys, Fishbone diagram, depth | Refusing to accept surface symptoms ("The server crashed") and digging for the root ("The disk was full"). |
| **[[1.6.6.5 Causal Graphing]]** | Visualization | Causal diagrams, directed edges, influence maps | Building a mental (or actual) graph of influences helps navigate complex systems. |
| **[[1.6.6.6 Interventions]]** | Action | "How do we stop X?", manipulating causes | Understanding causality allows us to intervene in the system to change the outcome. |
| **[[1.6.6.7 Mechanism Explanation]]** | Detail | "How does X cause Y?", step-by-step mechanism | It's not enough to say smoking causes cancer; explaining *how* (cellular damage) builds trust. |
| **[[1.6.6.8 Predictive Causality]]** | Forecasting | "If I do X, Y will happen", expected value | Predicting the *results* of actions before taking them is the basis of agency. |
| **[[1.6.6.9 Necessary vs Sufficient]]** | Logic | Conditionality, "A is needed but not enough" | Distinguishing between "Fuel is necessary for fire" and "Fuel is sufficient for fire" (you also need a match). |
| **[[1.6.6.10 Attribution Errors]]** | Psychology | Fundamental attribution error, blaming | Understanding when we falsely attribute cause to personality instead of situation. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Causal Reasoning**, understanding the *why* behind the *what*.
