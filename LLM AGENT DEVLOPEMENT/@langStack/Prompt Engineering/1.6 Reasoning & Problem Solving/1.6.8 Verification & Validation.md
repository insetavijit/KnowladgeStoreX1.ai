# 1.6.8 Verification & Validation

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.8.1 Self-Correction]]** | Autonomy | "Wait, I made a mistake", backspace equivalent | The ability to notice an error *during* generation and correct it immediately. |
| **[[1.6.8.2 Consistency Checking]]** | Logic | "Does A contradict B?", internal coherence | Scanning the generated text to ensure the first paragraph doesn't contradict the last. |
| **[[1.6.8.3 Fact-Checking]]** | Accuracy | Cross-referencing, citation verification, search tool | Using external tools (or internal knowledge) to verify specific claims (dates, names, numbers). |
| **[[1.6.8.4 Logical Consistency]]** | Validity | Argument validity, non-sequitur detection | checking if the conclusion actually follows from the premises. |
| **[[1.6.8.5 Output Validation]]** | Format | JSON schema check, type check, constraints | Ensuring the output matches the required format (e.g., valid JSON) before showing it to the user. |
| **[[1.6.8.6 Critique & Refine]]** | Iteration | "Rate this answer 1-5", improvement loop | Asking the model to critique its own draft and then write a better version (Reflexion). |
| **[[1.6.8.7 Peer Review Simulation]]** | Multi-agent | "As a critic, review this", devil's advocate | Using a second persona to aggressively find flaws in the first persona's work. |
| **[[1.6.8.8 External Tool Verification]]** | Grounding | Calculator, Python REPL, Database lookup | Offloading the verification of math or code to a deterministic tool (like a calculator). |
| **[[1.6.8.9 Confidence Thresholds]]** | Risk management | "If confidence < 90%, do not answer", safeguards | Setting a bar for quality; better to say nothing than to say something wrong? |
| **[[1.6.8.10 Error Taxonomy]]** | Classification | Hallucination, Logic Error, Math Error, Format Error | Categorizing *types* of errors helps in fine-tuning prompts to fix them. |
