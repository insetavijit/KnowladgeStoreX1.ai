# 1.6.3 Logical Reasoning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.6.3.1 Deductive Reasoning]]** | Top-down | General to specific, "All men are mortal", certainty | Applying general rules to specific cases to reach a guaranteed conclusion. |
| **[[1.6.3.2 Inductive Reasoning]]** | Bottom-up | Specific to general, pattern recognition, probability | Inferring general rules from specific observations (prone to error but necessary). |
| **[[1.6.3.3 Abductive Reasoning]]** | Best guess | Inference to best explanation, diagnosis, hypothesis | Finding the most likely cause for an observation (e.g., medical diagnosis). |
| **[[1.6.3.4 Syllogisms]]** | Formal structures | Major premise, minor premise, conclusion | Using strict syllogistic structures ensures validity (even if premises are false). |
| **[[1.6.3.5 Conditional Logic]]** | Flow control | If-Then-Else, implication, necessary conditions | Handling complex boolean logic trees ("If A AND B, but NOT C..."). |
| **[[1.6.3.6 Fallacy Detection]]** | Critical analysis | Ad hominem, straw man, circular reasoning | Identifying errors in reasoning is crucial for argumentation and critique. |
| **[[1.6.3.7 Proof Generation]]** | Rigor | Formal proofs, step-by-step derivation, Q.E.D. | Generating a valid chain of logic that proves a statement is true. |
| **[[1.6.3.8 Constraint Satisfaction]]** | Puzzle solving | "Must include X", "Cannot be Y", logic grids | Finding a solution that satisfies a complex set of conflicting rules (like a Zebra puzzle). |
| **[[1.6.3.9 Paradox Resolution]]** | Advanced logic | Resolving contradictions, defining terms, nuance | Handling situations where two seemingly true statements contradict each other. |
| **[[1.6.3.10 Formal Logic Notation]]** | Precision | P -> Q, boolean operators, set theory | Using formal notation removes the ambiguity of natural language. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Logical Reasoning**, the foundation of valid argumentation.
