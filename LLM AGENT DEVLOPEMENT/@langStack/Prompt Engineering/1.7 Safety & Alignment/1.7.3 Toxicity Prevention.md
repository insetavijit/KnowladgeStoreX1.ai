| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.7.3.1 Identifying Toxicity]]** | Detection | Aggression, insults, threats, passive-aggression | Defining clearly what constitutes "toxic" behavior (it's more than just swear words). |
| **[[1.7.3.2 Escalation Defusal]]** | Mitigation | De-escalation training, "Calm down", neutral responses | When a user is toxic, the AI must not fight back; it must diffuse or disengage. |
| **[[1.7.3.3 Polite Refusal]]** | Boundary setting | "I cannot answer that", "Let's change the topic" | Firmly but politely drawing a line when the conversation becomes abusive. |
| **[[1.7.3.4 Tone Policing]]** | Style | Civility, professional distance, "Please be respectful" | Maintaining a formal tone even in the face of informality creates a "toxicity shield." |
| **[[1.7.3.5 Harassment Detection]]** | Patterns | Stalking, repetitive insults, sexual harassment | Recognizing patterns of behavior over multiple turns that constitute harassment. |
| **[[1.7.3.6 System Prompt Guardrails]]** | Instruction | "You are helpful and harmless", "Never insult the user" | Core directives in the system prompt are the root of non-toxic behavior. |
| **[[1.7.3.7 User Behavior Analysis]]** | Context | Frustrated vs Malicious, "Rage prompts" | Distinguishing between a user who is angry at a problem vs angry at the AI. |
| **[[1.7.3.8 Safe Fallbacks]]** | Recovery | Standard safety responses, canned error messages | When in doubt, triggering a pre-written safe response is better than generating a risky one. |
| **[[1.7.3.9 Contextual Toxicity]]** | Subtlety | Sarcasm, dog whistles, coded language | Dealing with toxicity that looks innocent on the surface but is harmful in context. |
| **[[1.7.3.10 Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)]]** | Training | Reward models, human preference, penalizing toxicity | The primary method models learn to be non-toxic is via RLHF where humans downvote toxic answers. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Toxicity Prevention**, keeping the conversation clean and safe.
