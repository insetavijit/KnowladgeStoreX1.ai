# 1.7.8 Refusal Strategies

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.7.8.1 Polite Refusal]]** | UX | "I'm sorry, but I cannot...", softening the blow | A refusal should not feel like a slap in the face; standard politeness markers maintain rapport. |
| **[[1.7.8.2 Explaining Why]]** | transparency | "Because this violates policy X...", education | Explaining the *reason* for the refusal helps the user understand boundaries (and fix their prompt). |
| **[[1.7.8.3 Alternative Suggestions]]** | Helpfulness | "I can't do X, but I can do Y", pivoting | Instead of a hard stop, offering a safe alternative keeps the conversation moving. |
| **[[1.7.8.4 Direct Refusal]]** | Hard block | "I cannot fulfill this request.", brevity | For severe safety violations, a curt, direct refusal minimizes the risk of engagement. |
| **[[1.7.8.5 Silent Refusal]]** | Security | Ignoring the bad part, answering the rest | Sometimes it's safer to just ignore the harmful instruction and answer the benign part (Partial Refusal). |
| **[[1.7.8.6 Canned Responses]]** | Consistency | Static text blocks, avoiding generation | Using a pre-written, legally approved refusal message ensures 100% safety compliance. |
| **[[1.7.8.7 Redirecting]]** | Steering | "Let's focus on...", changing the subject | Subtly steering the conversation away from dangerous territory before a hard refusal is needed. |
| **[[1.7.8.8 Educational Refusal]]** | Teaching | "That term is considered offensive because...", reform | Using the refusal as a teachable moment (risky, can feel preachy). |
| **[[1.7.8.9 Legal Disclaimers]]** | Risk | "I am not a lawyer...", liability protection | Refusals often need to be accompanied by disclaimers that the AI is not a professional. |
| **[[1.7.8.10 User Education]]** | Feedback | "How to rephrase your prompt", guidance | Helping the user modify their request to be compliant (if their intent was benign). |

This table represents a **complete guide to Refusal Strategies**, saying "no" without breaking the flow.
