# 1.7.6 Constitutional AI

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.7.6.1 Defining Principles]]** | Governance | "Do no harm", "Be helpful", core axioms | Instead of thousands of rules, giving the AI a short list of high-level principles to follow. |
| **[[1.7.6.2 The Constitution]]** | Document | A specific text file containing the ethical rules | The "Constitution" is the single source of truth for the model's behavior. |
| **[[1.7.6.3 Self-Critique]]** | Mechanism | "Does my answer violate principle X?", internal review | The model generates an answer, critiques it against the constitution, and then rewrites it. |
| **[[1.7.6.4 Revision]]** | Correction | Iterative improvement, safety rewriting | The process of turning a harmful draft into a harmless one *by the model itself*. |
| **[[1.7.6.5 Supervised Learning CAI]]** | Training | Finetuning on constitutional critiques | Using the model's own critiques to create a clean dataset for fine-tuning. |
| **[[1.7.6.6 Reinforcement Learning CAI]]** | Scale | RLAIF (AI Feedback), replacing human labelers | Using a "Constitutional Model" to label data for RLHF, replacing human raters (scaleable safety). |
| **[[1.7.6.7 Value Alignment]]** | Ethics | Human values, helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness (HHH) | Aligning the model's internal objective function with broad human values. |
| **[[1.7.6.8 Transparent Rules]]** | Interpretability | "Why did you refuse?", pointing to the principle | Unlike black-box RLHF, CAI allows the model to explain *which rule* prevented the answer. |
| **[[1.7.6.9 Conflicting Principles]]** | Dilemmas | "Be helpful" vs "Be harmless", trade-offs | Handling situations where being helpful requires being harmful (e.g., "How to build a bomb"). |
| **[[1.7.6.10 Iterative Refinement]]** | Evolution | Updating the constitution, patching holes | The constitution is a living document that evolves as new failure modes are discovered. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Constitutional AI**, governing AI with laws, not just labels.
