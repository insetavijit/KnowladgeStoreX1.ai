# 1.10.5 A/B Testing

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.10.5.1 Variant Design]]** | Experiment | Control vs Treatment, "Prompt A vs Prompt B" | Creating two distinct versions of a prompt to test a specific hypothesis (e.g., "Is shorter better?"). |
| **[[1.10.5.2 Traffic Splitting]]** | Routing | 50/50 split, random assignment, stickiness | Determining which user sees which prompt (and ensuring they see the same one all session). |
| **[[1.10.5.3 Statistical Significance]]** | Math | p-values, confidence intervals, sample size | Knowing if Prompt B is *actually* better or if you just got lucky with the last 10 users. |
| **[[1.10.5.4 Sample Size Calculation]]** | Planning | Power analysis, "How many users do we need?" | Don't start a test unless you have enough traffic to detect the difference you care about. |
| **[[1.10.5.5 Success Metrics]]** | Goals | Click-through rate, acceptance rate, "Did they copy the answer?" | Defining upfront what "Winning" looks like so you don't cherry-pick data later. |
| **[[1.10.5.6 Multi-Armed Bandits]]** | Optimization | Thompson Sampling, explore-exploit | Automatically routing more traffic to the winning prompt *during* the test to minimize regret. |
| **[[1.10.5.7 Duration & Consistency]]** | Validity | Seasonality, day-of-week effects | Running a test long enough to average out Monday morning grumpiness vs Friday afternoon happiness. |
| **[[1.10.5.8 Cohort Analysis]]** | Segmentation | New vs Old users, Mobile vs Desktop | Checking if Prompt B is better for *everyone*, or just better for power users. |
| **[[1.10.5.9 Qualitative Feedback]]** | Insight | User comments, "Why did you dislike this?" | Numbers tell you *what* happened; comments tell you *why*. |
| **[[1.10.5.10 Shadow Deployment]]** | Risk mitigation | Running the new prompt in the background (invisible to user) | Comparing the new prompt's output to the old one without actually showing it to the user yet. |
