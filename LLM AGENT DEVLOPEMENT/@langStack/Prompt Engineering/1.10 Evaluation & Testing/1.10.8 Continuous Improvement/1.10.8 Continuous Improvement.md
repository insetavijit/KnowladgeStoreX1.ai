# 1.10.8 Continuous Improvement

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.10.8.1 Kaizen for AI]]** | Philosophy | "Better every day", incrementalism | The belief that small, daily improvements to prompts add up to massive quality gains. |
| **[[1.10.8.2 Feedback Loops]]** | Cycle | Data Flywheel, User Data -> Model | Structuring the product so that every user interaction makes the next version better. |
| **[[1.10.8.3 Retraining Cycles]]** | Schedule | Weekly fine-tuning, nightly eval runs | Establishing a cadence for updating the models and prompts (don't specific ad-hoc updates). |
| **[[1.10.8.4 Prompt Refactoring]]** | Maintenance | Cleanup, decoupling, simplification | removing old instructions that are no longer needed prevents "Prompt Rot". |
| **[[1.10.8.5 Version Integration]]** | Updates | Testing new model versions (GPT-4 -> GPT-4.5) | Being ready to swap in the newest model the day it drops requires a robust pipeline. |
| **[[1.10.8.6 Learning from Production]]** | Insight | "What are users *actually* asking?" | Using real user logs to inform the roadmap, not just your imagination. |
| **[[1.10.8.7 Organizational Memory]]** | Knowledge | Post-mortems, "What worked?", wiki | Writing down what didn't work so you don't make the same mistake twice. |
| **[[1.10.8.8 Roadmap Planning]]** | Strategy | "Next quarter: RAG", "Q4: Agents" | Planning major architectural shifts vs minor prompt tweaks. |
| **[[1.10.8.9 Deprecation Strategies]]** | Lifecycle | Sunseting old prompts, version retirement | Turning off the old endpoints cleanly without breaking legacy clients. |
| **[[1.10.8.10 Automated Optimization]]** | Future | DSPy, auto-optimizers, self-healing | Moving towards a world where the system improves itself without human intervention. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Continuous Improvement**, the engine of growth.
