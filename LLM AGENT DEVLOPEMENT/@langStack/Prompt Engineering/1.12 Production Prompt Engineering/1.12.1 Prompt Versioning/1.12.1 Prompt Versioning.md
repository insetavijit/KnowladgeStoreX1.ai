# 1.12.1 Prompt Versioning

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.12.1.1 Git for Prompts]]** | Source control | Commit history, blame, code review | Treating prompts as code (PaaC) and storing them in Git, not in a database or wiki. |
| **[[1.12.1.2 Semantic Versioning]]** | Standards | `v1.0.0` (Breaking.Feature.Fix) | A prompt change that breaks JSON output is a MAJOR version; a typo fix is a PATCH. |
| **[[1.12.1.3 Change Logs]]** | Documentation | "What changed and why?", intent tracking | Writing down *why* you changed the prompt allows future engineers to understand the intent. |
| **[[1.12.1.4 Rollback Strategies]]** | Reliability | "Revert to v1.2", instant undo | The ability to instantly switch back to the previous prompt version if metrics tank. |
| **[[1.12.1.5 Branching & Merging]]** | Workflow | Feature branches, conflict resolution | working on experimental prompts in a separate branch before merging to main. |
| **[[1.12.1.6 Diffing Prompts]]** | Visuals | Visual diff tools, highlighting changes | Seeing exactly which words changed between v1 and v2. |
| **[[1.12.1.7 Metadata Tracking]]** | Context | Author, Date, Linked Ticket | tracking who changed the prompt and which Jira ticket requested the change. |
| **[[1.12.1.8 Peer Review]]** | Quality | Pull Requests, approval gates | No prompt goes to production without a second pair of eyes. |
| **[[1.12.1.9 Immutable Snapshots]]** | Integrity | SHA hashing, database locking | Ensuring that `v1.2` always returns the exact same prompt string, forever. |
| **[[1.12.1.10 Artifact Registry]]** | storage | Storing prompt bundles like Docker images | Packaging prompts and their associated config into deployable artifacts. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Prompt Versioning**, treating English as Code.
