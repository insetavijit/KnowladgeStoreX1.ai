# 1.12.7 Observability

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.12.7.1 Distributed Tracing]]** | Visibility | OpenTelemetry, span ID, full journey | Tracking a request from the frontend -> backend -> vector DB -> LLM -> frontend. |
| **[[1.12.7.2 Structured Logging]]** | Format | JSON logs, key-value pairs | Logging `{ "prompt_tokens": 50, "model": "gpt-4" }` instead of "User sent 50 tokens". |
| **[[1.12.7.3 Input/Output Capture]]** | Data | "Log the full prompt", privacy masking | Saving the exact text sent and received is the only way to debug hallucination. |
| **[[1.12.7.4 Error Tracking (Sentry)]]** | Debugging | Stack traces, API error codes | Catching exceptions (like 500s) and inspecting the variables at the moment of crash. |
| **[[1.12.7.5 Performance APO]]** | Metrics | Latency histograms, percentile tracking | Profiling which part of the chain is slow (is it the DB or the LLM?). |
| **[[1.12.7.6 Feedback Collection]]** | Quality | Explicit user feedback, thumbs up/down | logging the user's reaction alongside the prompt that generated it. |
| **[[1.12.7.7 Sentiment Monitoring]]** | Analysis | "Are users getting angry?", tone analysis | Running a cheap classifier on user inputs to detect frustration spikes. |
| **[[1.12.7.8 Visualization (Grafana)]]** | Dashboard | Time-series graphs, error rate spikes | Seeing problems visually before users report them. |
| **[[1.12.7.9 Privacy Masking in Logs]]** | Compliance | Redacting PII, never logging passwords | ensuring your debug logs don't become a GDPR violation. |
| **[[1.12.7.10 Alerting Rules]]** | Operations | "If success rate < 99%, page me" | Defining the boundaries of acceptable system behavior. |
