# 1.12.8 Deployment Strategies

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.12.8.1 Blue-Green Deployment]]** | Safety | Two environments, instant switch | Spinning up the new version (Green) alongside the old (Blue) and switching traffic instantly. |
| **[[1.12.8.2 Canary Releases]]** | Risk | "1% of users", gradual rollout | Releasing the new prompt to only 1% of users to see if it breaks before going to 100%. |
| **[[1.12.8.3 Feature Flags]]** | Control | "Enable New Prompt", toggle switch | Wrapping prompt logic in an `if (feature_enabled)` block to turn it on/off without redeploying code. |
| **[[1.12.8.4 Gradual Rollout]]** | Ramping | 10% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100% | Slowly increasing the load to ensure the infrastructure (and budget) can handle it. |
| **[[1.12.8.5 Shadow Testing]]** | Validation | Dark launch, comparison, no user impact | Running the new prompt on live traffic but throwing away the result (just to test errors/latency). |
| **[[1.12.8.6 Rollback Triggers]]** | Automation | "If 500s > 1%, revert" | Automatically undoing a deployment if the error rate spikes. |
| **[[1.12.8.7 Version Pinning]]** | Stability | Locking dependencies, `gpt-4-0613` | Always specifying the *exact* model version hash, never "latest", to prevent surprise updates. |
| **[[1.12.8.8 Compliance Checks]]** | Gatekeeping | "Did Legal approve?", manual gates | Ensuring sensitive deployments (e.g., medical advice) have a manual approval step. |
| **[[1.12.8.9 Multi-Region Deploys]]** | Latency | Edge functions, "server near user" | Deploying the prompting logic close to the user (though the LLM API is usually central). |
| **[[1.12.8.10 Maintenance Windows]]** | Communication | Status page, downtime handling | How to handle planned updates that might disrupt service (rare for modern apps). |
