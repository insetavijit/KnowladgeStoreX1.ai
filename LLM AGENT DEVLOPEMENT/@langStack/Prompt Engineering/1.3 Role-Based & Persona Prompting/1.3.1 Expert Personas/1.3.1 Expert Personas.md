| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.3.1.1 The Prone-To Pattern ("Act as...")]]** | Role induction | System message framing, behavioral priming, specialized vernacular | Assigning a specific role primes the model to access a designated cluster of training data and stylistic norms. |
| **[[1.3.1.2 Defining Domain Boundaries]]** | Scope management | "You are an expert in X, not Y", limiting hallucinations | Explicitly defining what the persona *doesn't* know prevents it from confidently hallucinating outside its expertise. |
| **[[1.3.1.3 Jargon & Terminology Injection]]** | Linguistic precision | Domain-specific vocabulary, acronyms, technical register | Forcing the use of correct terminology ensures the output feels authentic to professional users. |
| **[[1.3.1.4 Authority & Confidence Calibration]]** | Tone adjustment | Hedging vs assertive, "Answer decisively", uncertainty markers | Adjusting the persona's confidence level ensures it sounds like a senior expert rather than a hesitant junior. |
| **[[1.3.1.5 Expert Heuristics]]** | Rule-of-thumb | "Think like a senior engineer", best practices, tacit knowledge | Prompting for "heuristics" encourages the model to apply experience-based shortcuts typical of human experts. |
| **[[1.3.1.6 Simulating Professional Roles (Lawyer, Doctor)]]** | High-stakes personas | Ethical guardrails, disclaimer injection, professional standards | Simulating regulated professions requires strict adherence to safety guidelines and disclaimers. |
| **[[1.3.1.7 Handling Limits of Expertise]]** | Fallback behavior | "If outside scope, state X", admitting ignorance | A true expert knows what they don't know; programming this humility prevents dangerous misinformation. |
| **[[1.3.1.8 Multi-Persona Collaboration]]** | Ensemble simulation | "Act as a board of directors", conflicting viewpoints | simulating a debate between different expert personas can yield a more balanced and vetted solution. |
| **[[1.3.1.9 Expert Critique Personas]]** | Review mechanism | "Criticize this as a security auditor", red-teaming | Using a hostile or critical expert persona to review content is a powerful way to find flaws. |
| **[[1.3.1.10 Persona Decay Management]]** | Context maintenance | Reminders, "Stay in character", persistent instructions | Long conversations can cause the model to drift back to being a generic assistant; regular reminders are needed. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Expert Personas**, enabling high-fidelity simulation of professional knowledge workers.
