# 1.3.5 Cognitive Prompting

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.3.5.1 System 1 vs System 2 Thinking]]** | Thinking speeds | Kahneman, fast (intuitive) vs slow (deliberate), reasoning activation | Prompting the model to "think deliberately" shifts it from rapid token prediction to simulated reasoning. |
| **[[1.3.5.2 Critical Thinking Frameworks]]** | Analysis rules | Logical fallacies, bias detection, SWOT analysis | Applying specific critical thinking frameworks forces the model to evaluate information more rigorously. |
| **[[1.3.5.3 Lateral Thinking Prompts]]** | Creativity | De Bono, random stimulus, challenging assumptions | Lateral thinking prompts encourage the model to break standard association patterns and generate novel ideas. |
| **[[1.3.5.4 First Principles Reasoning]]** | Fundamental decomposition | Physics-based reasoning, "Boil it down", axioms | Solving problems by breaking them down to fundamental truths avoids reasoning by analogy or convention. |
| **[[1.3.5.5 Analogical Reasoning]]** | Transfer learning | "X is like Y", cross-domain mapping, metaphor | Asking the model to use analogies helps explain complex new concepts using familiar old ones. |
| **[[1.3.5.6 Scientific Method Prompting]]** | Empirical cycle | Hypothesis generation, testing, observation, conclusion | Structuring the prompt as a scientific experiment forces a logical, evidence-based progression. |
| **[[1.3.5.7 Heuristic Evaluation]]** | Usability/Expertise | Nielsen's heuristics, rule-based checking, best practices | Using established heuristics provides a standard checklist for evaluating designs or plans. |
| **[[1.3.5.8 Biased vs Objectivity Modes]]** | Perspective control | "Argue for X", "Neutral observer", steelmanning | Explicitly setting the cognitive mode prevents the model's default "helpful agent" bias from coloring the output. |
| **[[1.3.5.9 Creative Brainstorming]]** | Divergent thinking | SCAMPER method, "no bad ideas", quantity over quality | Specific brainstorming prompts switch the model from convergence (finding the answer) to divergence (finding *any* answer). |
| **[[1.3.5.10 Mental Models]]** | Cognitive tools | Pareto principle, Occam's razor, Hanlon's razor | Invoking specific mental models gives the AI a "lens" through which to analyze the problem. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Cognitive Prompting**, upgrading the model's "mindware" for better thinking.
