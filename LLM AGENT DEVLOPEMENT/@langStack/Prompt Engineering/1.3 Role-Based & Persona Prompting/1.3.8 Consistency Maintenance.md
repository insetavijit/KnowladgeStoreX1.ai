# 1.3.8 Consistency Maintenance

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.3.8.1 Context Window Decay]]** | Memory loss | Fog of war, tail-end forgetting, sliding window limits | As the conversation grows, the earliest instructions (like the persona) are the first to fall out of focus. |
| **[[1.3.8.2 Periodic Reinforcement]]** | Reminder injection | "Remember to act as...", injected system beats | Periodically re-injecting the core persona instructions ("You are still X") prevents drift. |
| **[[1.3.8.3 Summary-Based Recall]]** | Compression | Conversation summaries, active state tracking | Summarizing previous decisions and feeding them back in keeps the character consistent over long turns. |
| **[[1.3.8.4 Style Guides as Context]]** | Static reference | Persistent style rules, "Always/Never" lists | Keeping a style guide in the system prompt acts as a permanent "north star" for consistency. |
| **[[1.3.8.5 Few-Shot Style Anchoring]]** | Example reinforcement | Dynamic few-shot examples (last 3 turns) | Using the *model's own previous best outputs* as few-shot examples reinforces its style. |
| **[[1.3.8.6 Monitoring Drift]]** | Quality control | Output analysis, drift detection, tone shift | Automatically monitoring outputs for signs of reverting to "default AI" behavior allows for early correction. |
| **[[1.3.8.7 Handling Long Conversations]]** | Session management | Token management, summarization, entity tracking | For sessions exceeding the context window, external memory systems are needed to maintain identity. |
| **[[1.3.8.8 Global vs Local Consistency]]** | Logic coherency | World-building laws vs immediate conversation flow | Use global variables (World Bible) to ensure local answers don't contradict established world facts. |
| **[[1.3.8.9 System Message Persistence]]** | Instruction weighting | Weighting system prompt, "Do not forget" | Modern models prioritize system messages; keep the core persona there, not in the user history. |
| **[[1.3.8.10 Automated Consistency Checks]]** | Verification | Self-correction loop, "Does this match the persona?" | An internal thought step ("Is this response consistent with my character?") helps catch breaks before replying. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Consistency Maintenance**, the engineering required to keep a persona alive over time.
