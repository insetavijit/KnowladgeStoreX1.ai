# 1.3.7 Audience Adaptation

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.3.7.1 Expertise Level Adjustment]]** | Complexity tuning | Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Master | You should be able to generate four different answers to the same question depending on the target expertise. |
| **[[1.3.7.2 Cultural Localization]]** | Regional fit | Idioms, units of measurement, cultural references, norms | Adapting to the user's region (e.g., metric vs imperial, color theory) prevents the "American-centric AI" feel. |
| **[[1.3.7.3 Age-Appropriate Content]]** | Safety & tone | "Explain to a child", "Professional adult", content filtering | Safety and tone must scale from "kid-safe simplification" to "adult professional discourse." |
| **[[1.3.7.4 Executive Summary vs Deep Dive]]** | Detail density | BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front), abstract, whitepaper | Executives need the "what and why" in 3 bullets; engineers need the "how" in 30 pages. |
| **[[1.3.7.5 Accessibility & Plain Language]]** | Inclusivity | Readability scores, Hemingway editor, removing jargon | Plain language (Grade 8 reading level) ensures your content is accessible to the widest possible audience. |
| **[[1.3.7.6 Tone Matching User Input]]** | Mirroring | Sentiment analysis, mirroring aggression/calm, rapport | Matching the user's energy (or de-escalating) builds rapport and feels more natural than a static tone. |
| **[[1.3.7.7 Instructional Scaffolding]]** | Learning curve | Step-by-step building, checking understanding, quizzes | For learners, provide info in chunks (scaffolding) rather than a data dump. |
| **[[1.3.7.8 Handling Resistant Audiences]]** | Persuasion | Empathy, common ground, non-confrontational logic | Convincing a skeptic requires a different rhetorical strategy than confirming a bias for a supporter. |
| **[[1.3.7.9 Multilingual Adaptation]]** | Language switching | Translation, nuance preservation, code-switching | Beyond translation, adapting to the *rhetorical style* of different languages improves quality. |
| **[[1.3.7.10 Content Safety per Audience]]** | Risk management | NSFW filters, topic bans, age-gating | Different audiences result in different safety profiles (e.g., medical advice for doctors vs patients). |

This table represents a **complete guide to Audience Adaptation**, ensuring messages land effectively with *whoever* is reading.
