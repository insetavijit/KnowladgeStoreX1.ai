# 1.13.3 Meta-Prompting

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.13.3.1 Prompting the Prompter]]** | Recursion | "You are an expert prompt engineer..." | Asking the AI to help you write the prompt you are about to use. |
| **[[1.13.3.2 Persona Generators]]** | Identity | "Create a persona for this task" | Asking the AI to invent the perfect expert to solve the problem. |
| **[[1.13.3.3 Task Specification Prompts]]** | Alignment | "Clarify the goal first", requirements gathering | A meta-prompt that forces the model to ask clarifying questions before starting. |
| **[[1.13.3.4 Reflection on Rules]]** | Safety | "Did I follow the rules?", self-audit | Instructions that force the model to re-read the system prompt before answering. |
| **[[1.13.3.5 Dynamic System Prompts]]** | Adaptation | Changing the system prompt at runtime | Swapping the "Core Rules" based on the user's intent classification. |
| **[[1.13.3.6 Recursive Improvement]]** | Quality | "Improve this answer, then improve the improvement" | Infinite loops of self-refinement (until budget runs out). |
| **[[1.13.3.7 Strategy Synthesis]]** | Planning | "Propose 3 strategies, then pick the best" | Asking the model to plan its approach before executing it. |
| **[[1.13.3.8 Meta-Cognition]]** | Awareness | "Think about your thinking", introspection | Prompting the model to monitor its own reasoning process. |
| **[[1.13.3.9 Instructions for Instructions]]** | Guidelines | "Write instructions for a junior dev" | Using the LLM to generate SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for other agents. |
| **[[1.13.3.10 Higher-Order logic]]** | Abstraction | Operating on the process, not the data | Managing the *flow* of information rather than the information itself. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Meta-Prompting**, thinking about thinking.
