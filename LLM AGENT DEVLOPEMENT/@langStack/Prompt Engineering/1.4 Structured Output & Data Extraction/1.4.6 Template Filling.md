# 1.4.6 Template Filling

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.4.6.1 Placeholder Syntax]]** | Delimiters | `{{variable}}`, `[INSERT NAME]`, explicit markers | Clear, unique placeholder syntax ensures the model knows exactly where to inject data. |
| **[[1.4.6.2 Variable Substitution]]** | Data injection | Context merging, f-string logic, entity replacement | Reliably replacing every instance of a placeholder with the correct value is the core task. |
| **[[1.4.6.3 Conditional Logic]]** | Dynamic templates | "If X, include paragraph Y", optional sections | Templates often need conditional branches based on the available data (e.g., different email for pro/free users). |
| **[[1.4.6.4 Mad Libs Prompting]]** | Constrained generation | Fill-in-the-blank, rigid sentence structure | Providing a complete sentence with a blank forces the model to generate *only* the missing word. |
| **[[1.4.6.5 Email Templates]]** | Communication | Subject lines, signatures, tone matching, personalization | Generating personalized emails from a generic template scale outreach without losing the human touch. |
| **[[1.4.6.6 Report Generation]]** | Document assembly | Standard sections, dynamic data injection, executive summaries | Automating monthly reports involves filling a static structure with this month's dynamic numbers. |
| **[[1.4.6.7 Maintaining Static Text]]** | Fidelity | "Do not change the boilerplate", legal disclaimers | Validating that the model *didn't* hallucinate changes to the immutable parts of the template is critical. |
| **[[1.4.6.8 Dynamic List Expansion]]** | Loop logic | Generating bullet points `N` times, variable length lists | Handling templates where one section needs to expand to fit a variable number of items. |
| **[[1.4.6.9 Form Filling]]** | Data entry | HTML inputs, PDF fields, structured completion | Simulating a user filling out a structured form requires precise mapping of answers to fields. |
| **[[1.4.6.10 Template Versioning]]** | Management | tracking template IDs, A/B testing copy | Managing different versions of templates allows for optimizing the "shell" independently of the API. |
