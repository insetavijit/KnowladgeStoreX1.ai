# 1.4.4 Field Extraction

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.4.4.1 Named Entity Recognition (NER)]]** | Entity ID | Person, Org, Loc, Date, custom entities | Extracting specific entities from unstructured text is one of the most common LLM utility tasks. |
| **[[1.4.4.2 Unstructured to Structured]]** | Data normalization | Resume parsing, invoice extraction, bio scraping | Converting messy, human-written documents into clean database rows is a superpower of LLMs. |
| **[[1.4.4.3 Handling Missing Data]]** | Null safety | "If not found, return null", hallucination prevention | Crucially, the model must be taught to return nothing when the data isn't there, rather than inventing it. |
| **[[1.4.4.4 Confidence Scores per Field]]** | Reliability | Probability output, "confidence: high/low", validation | Asking the model to rate its own confidence for each extracted field helps flag manual reviews. |
| **[[1.4.4.5 Multi-Value Extraction]]** | Lists | Extracting all instances, handling duplicates | extracting *lists* of items (e.g., "all skills mentioned") requires distinct handling from single fields. |
| **[[1.4.4.6 Date & Time Normalization]]** | format standardization | ISO 8601, relative time ("next tuesday"), timezone handling | Converting "next Friday" into "2024-10-25" allows the data to be used by calendars and databases. |
| **[[1.4.4.7 Address & Phone Parsing]]** | Geodata | Formatting, validation, international formats | Parsing addresses into components (Street, City, Zip) makes them mapping-ready. |
| **[[1.4.4.8 Relationship Extraction]]** | Graph data | "X is wife of Y", "A works for B", semantic links | Identifying how entities relate to each other allows for building knowledge graphs. |
| **[[1.4.4.9 Sentiment Extraction]]** | Nuance | Aspect-based sentiment, extracting opinion targets | Extracting *what* the user liked (e.g., "food: positive", "service: negative") is richer than a single score. |
| **[[1.4.4.10 Extraction Verification]]** | Accuracy check | "Quote the source text", citation, provenance | Asking the model to include the snippet it used to extract the data allows for easy verification. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Field Extraction**, empowering you to mine value from unstructured text.
