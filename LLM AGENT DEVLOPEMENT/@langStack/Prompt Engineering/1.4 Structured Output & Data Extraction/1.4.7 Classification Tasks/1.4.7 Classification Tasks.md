# 1.4.7 Classification Tasks

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.4.7.1 Binary Classification]]** | Yes/No | Spam detection, sentiment (pos/neg), boolean flags | The simplest classification task; force a True/False or Yes/No output. |
| **[[1.4.7.2 Multi-Class Classification]]** | Single label | Categorization, "Choose one of X", mutually exclusive | Picking the *best* single category from a list of defined options. |
| **[[1.4.7.3 Multi-Label Classification]]** | Tagging | "Choose all that apply", keyword extraction, non-exclusive | Assigning multiple relevant tags to a single input (e.g., a movie can be both Horror and Comedy). |
| **[[1.4.7.4 Taxonomy Hierarchy]]** | Tree structure | Parent-child categories, detailed routing, drill-down | Classifying into a broad category first (L1), then a specific sub-category (L2) improves accuracy. |
| **[[1.4.7.5 Intent Recognition]]** | Routing | "Sales vs Support", user goal identification, action mapping | Identifying *what the user wants to do* is the first step in any agentic system. |
| **[[1.4.7.6 Sentiment Analysis]]** | Emotion tagging | 5-star scale, emotional flavor, granular sentiment | Going beyond positive/negative to detect frustration, joy, sarcasm, or urgency. |
| **[[1.4.7.7 Handling "Other" Categories]]** | Fallback | "None of the above", "Unclassified", robust design | Including a catch-all category prevents the model from forcing a square peg into a round hole. |
| **[[1.4.7.8 Probability Scores]]** | Confidence | Logprobs, soft labels, ranking options | Knowing *how sure* the model is allows you to automate high-confidence examples and route low ones to humans. |
| **[[1.4.7.9 Few-Shot Classifiers]]** | In-context training | Providing 5 examples of each class, semantic definition | Showing examples of each category is often more effective than writing a definition. |
| **[[1.4.7.10 Consistency Checking]]** | Evaluation | Inter-annotator agreement, stability testing | Ensuring the model classifies the same input the same way every time is key for production systems. |
