# 1.4.8 Regular Expressions

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.4.8.1 Generating Regex]]** | Code writing | "Write a regex for X", syntax correctness, complexity management | LLMs are surprisingly good at writing complex regex patterns that would take humans hours to debug. |
| **[[1.4.8.2 Explaining Regex]]** | De-obfuscation | "What does this do?", plain english breakdown, maintenance | Asking the model to explain a legacy regex is invaluable for understanding old codebases. |
| **[[1.4.8.3 Validating Regex]]** | Testing | Test cases, edge case matching, catastrophic backtracking checks | Generating test strings to prove the regex works (and fails) as expected. |
| **[[1.4.8.4 Regex for Constraints]]** | Output guidance | Constrained decoding, BNF grammars, pattern enforcement | Using a regex structure to *force* the model's output to match a specific pattern (e.g., strict JSON). |
| **[[1.4.8.5 Pattern Matching Prompts]]** | Heuristic search | "Find strings looking like X", fuzzy matching | Instructing the model to act *as* a regex engine to find patterns that are too complex for actual regex. |
| **[[1.4.8.6 Extraction Patterns]]** | Parsing logic | Grouping, capture groups, named groups | teaching the model to output content in a format that easier for *downstream* regex to extract. |
| **[[1.4.8.7 Substitution Patterns]]** | Refactoring | sed-style replacement, bulk editing, format migration | Using regex logic to perform consistent find-and-replace operations across a text. |
| **[[1.4.8.8 Lookaheads & Lookbehinds]]** | Advanced syntax | Positive/Negative assertions, context matching | leveraging advanced regex features for complex validation logic. |
| **[[1.4.8.9 Optimizing Regex]]** | Performance | Reducing steps, simplifying logic, avoiding wildcards | Asking the model to "make this regex more efficient" can prevent ReDoS attacks. |
| **[[1.4.8.10 Common Regex Libraries]]** | Compatibility | PCRE vs JS vs Python, flavor adjustment | Ensuring the generated regex is compatible with the specific programming language you are using. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Regular Expressions**, bridging the gap between fuzzy AI and rigid string parsing.
