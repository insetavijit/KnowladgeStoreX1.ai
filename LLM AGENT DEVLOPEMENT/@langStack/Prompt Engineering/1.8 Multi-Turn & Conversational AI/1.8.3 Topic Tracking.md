# 1.8.3 Topic Tracking

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.8.3.1 Topic Identification]]** | Labeling | "Current topic: Pricing", classifying intent | Assigning a tag to the current turn allows the system to route it to the right logic. |
| **[[1.8.3.2 Topic Switching]]** | Transitions | "By the way...", detecting abrupt shifts | Recognizing when the user has abandoned the old topic and started a new one. |
| **[[1.8.3.3 Maintaining Thread]]** | Focus | Ignoring distractions, bringing user back | If the system has a goal, it must gently steer the user back to the topic if they wander. |
| **[[1.8.3.4 Sub-Topic Management]]** | Hierarchy | Drill-down, nesting, stack management | Handling "Topic A -> Subtopic B -> Subtopic C" and then popping back up to B. |
| **[[1.8.3.5 Returning to Previous Topics]]** | Recall | "As we discussed earlier...", contextual linking | Seamlessly referencing a topic from 10 turns ago makes the conversation feel cohesive. |
| **[[1.8.3.6 Topic Summarization]]** | Compression | "So far we've covered...", milestone markers | Summarizing the current topic before closing it helps cement understanding. |
| **[[1.8.3.7 Multi-Threaded Conversations]]** | Complexity | Handling two topics at once, interleaved replies | "To answer your first question... and regarding the second..." |
| **[[1.8.3.8 Drift Detection]]** | Alerting | Semantic drift, "Are we still talking about X?" | Detecting when the conversation has gradually moved away from the original goal. |
| **[[1.8.3.9 Context Switching]]** | State | Clearing variables, resetting slots | When the topic changes (e.g., from "Booking" to "Support"), the relevant variables must change too. |
| **[[1.8.3.10 Sidebar Conversations]]** | Tangents | Handling brief digressions then returning | Allowing a joke or quick question without losing the main thread of the task. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Topic Tracking**, keeping the conversation focused and organized.
