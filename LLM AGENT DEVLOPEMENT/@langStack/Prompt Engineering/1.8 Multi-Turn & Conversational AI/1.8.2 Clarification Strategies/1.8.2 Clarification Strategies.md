| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.8.2.1 Ambiguity Detection]]** | Awareness | "Does this have multiple meanings?", uncertainty check | Recognizing that "I want a bank" could mean a river bank or a financial bank. |
| **[[1.8.2.2 Asking for Details]]** | Inquiry | "Can you specify?", "What kind of...?" | Proactively asking the user to fill in missing information before attempting an answer. |
| **[[1.8.2.3 Confirming Understanding]]** | Mirroring | "So you mean...", paraphrasing, active listening | Repeating the user's request back to them in different words to ensure alignment. |
| **[[1.8.2.4 Disambiguation]]** | Selection | "Did you mean A or B?", menus | Presenting a clear choice to resolve ambiguity quickly. |
| **[[1.8.2.5 Multiple Choice Questions]]** | UI | "1. Option A, 2. Option B", guided selection | reducing user cognitive load by offering structured choices instead of open-ended questions. |
| **[[1.8.2.6 Iterative Refinement]]** | Loop | "Is this closer?", feedback cycles | Working with the user through multiple turns to drill down to the exact requirement. |
| **[[1.8.2.7 Reflective Listening]]** | Empathy | "It sounds like you are looking for...", validation | Making the user feel heard often clarifies the intent better than direct questioning. |
| **[[1.8.2.8 Slot Filling]]** | Data collection | "I need date, time, and location", form simulation | A systematic approach to asking questions until all required variable "slots" are filled. |
| **[[1.8.2.9 Handling Vague Queries]]** | Interpretation | "Help me", broad intent, narrowing | When the user gives zero context ("Doesn't work"), asking diagnostic questions ("What doesn't work?"). |
| **[[1.8.2.10 Probing Questions]]** | Depth | "Why do you need this?", root cause discovery | Asking deeper questions to uncover the *real* problem behind the stated problem. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Clarification Strategies**, avoiding the error of answering the wrong question.
