| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.8.4.1 Turn Taking]]** | Protocol | User-Assistant-User cycle, request-response | The fundamental heartbeat of a chat; ensuring the AI knows when it's its turn to speak. |
| **[[1.8.4.2 Interruption Handling]]** | Flow breaking | "Stop generating", user intervention, new input | Handling cases where the user sends a new message while the AI is still typing. |
| **[[1.8.4.3 Pacing]]** | Timing | Delays, typing indicators, "Let me think..." | mimicking human pacing (e.g., not replying instantly to a complex question) can improve UI experience. |
| **[[1.8.4.4 Response Length]]** | Calibration | Short vs Long, verbosity matching | Matching the length of the response to the complexity of the question (and the user's preference). |
| **[[1.8.4.5 Double Messaging]]** | UX | Splitting response into bubbles, multi-part answers | Sending two short messages is often more readable than one wall of text. |
| **[[1.8.4.6 Silence Handling]]** | Timeout | "Are you still there?", nudges | If the user stops responding, should the AI nudge them or wait forever? |
| **[[1.8.4.7 Turn Classification]]** | Analysis | Question, Statement, Greeting, command | Classifying *what kind* of turn the user just took determines the response strategy. |
| **[[1.8.4.8 Back-channeling]]** | Acknowledgement | "I see", "Go on", "Uh-huh" | Using short, non-substantive turns to encourage the user to keep talking. |
| **[[1.8.4.9 Initiative]]** | Control | "Mixed initiative", who asks the questions? | Deciding whether the AI asks the next question (AI-driven) or waits for the user (User-driven). |
| **[[1.8.4.10 Yielding the Floor]]** | Engagement | Ending with a question, passing the ball | Always ending a turn with a prompt for the user ensures the conversation doesn't die. |
