# 1.8.6 Conversation Repair

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.8.6.1 Error Recognition]]** | Awareness | "I misunderstood", "That wasn't what you asked" | Recognizing when a conversation has gone off the rails is the first step to fixing it. |
| **[[1.8.6.2 Apology Strategy]]** | Tone | "My apologies", "I see where I went wrong", non-defensive | Apologizing correctly (briefly, sincerely) without groveling restores trust. |
| **[[1.8.6.3 Correction Mechanism]]** | Fix | Rewriting the last turn, "Let me try again", edit mode | The ability to overwrite a bad previous turn with a good one (conceptually or literally). |
| **[[1.8.6.4 Backtracking]]** | Navigation | "Let's go back to step 2", undo | allowing the user to "Undo" a conversation decision (e.g., "Actually, I want the blue one"). |
| **[[1.8.6.5 Restarting Logic]]** | Reset | "Start over", clearing context, "Let's start fresh" | Sometimes the context is so polluted the best repair is a hard reset. |
| **[[1.8.6.6 Clarifying Misunderstandings]]** | Alignment | "I thought you meant X, but you meant Y?" | Explicitly stating the misunderstanding helps prevent it from happening again. |
| **[[1.8.6.7 Re-planning]]** | Agility | Changing the plan mid-stream, dynamic adjustment | If the user rejects the proposed plan, the AI must instantly generate a new one. |
| **[[1.8.6.8 User Correction Handling]]** | Feedback | "No, not like that", "Wrong", accepting feedback | Handling negative feedback gracefully and using it as a constraint for the next attempt. |
| **[[1.8.6.9 Graceful Degradation]]** | Failure | "I can't help with that specific part", partial success | Admitting failure on one sub-task while still solving the rest of the request. |
| **[[1.8.6.10 Recovery Prompts]]** | Guidance | "Would you like me to try X instead?" | Suggesting a path forward after a failure keeps the user engaged. |
