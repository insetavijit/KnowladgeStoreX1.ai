| **[[1.8.5.1 User Modeling]]** | Profiling | User attributes, explicit vs implicit, profile building | Building a mental model of *who* the user is (e.g., "Developer", "Novice", "Impatient"). |
| **[[1.8.5.2 Preference Learning]]** | Adaptation | "Don't use code", "Be brief", learning from feedback | Remembering explicit instructions ("Stop calling me 'User'") across the conversation. |
| **[[1.8.5.3 Adaptation]]** | Flexibility | Changing difficulty, adjusting tone, shifting strategy | Automatically adjusting the output style to match the user's observed level of expertise. |
| **[[1.8.5.4 Memory of Preferences]]** | Persistence | User settings, "Remember my name", "I like python" | Storing user-specific facts in a permanent store (Long Term Memory) vs session memory. |
| **[[1.8.5.5 Style Matching]]** | Mirroring | Matching user complexity, vocab, and sentence length | If the user writes short, punchy sentences, the AI should do the same to build rapport. |
| **[[1.8.5.6 Role Customization]]** | Configuration | "Call me 'Coach'", "Act as my therapist" | Allowing the user to define the relationship dynamic explicitly. |
| **[[1.8.5.7 Long-term Memory]]** | Vectors | Vector stores for user history, "Last week you said..." | Retrieving relevant facts from conversations that happened weeks ago. |
| **[[1.8.5.8 User Segments]]** | Grouping | "Power User" vs "Casual", A/B testing personas | categorizing users into buckets to apply pre-optimized strategies for that group. |
| **[[1.8.5.9 Adaptive Content]]** | Relevance | Showing advanced options only to experts | Hiding complexity from beginners while exposing it to power users. |
| **[[1.8.5.10 Privacy & Personalization]]** | Ethics | "Don't be creepy", data minimization, opt-out | Balancing the helpfulness of "I know where you live" with the creepiness of it. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Personalization**, making the AI feel like *your* AI.
