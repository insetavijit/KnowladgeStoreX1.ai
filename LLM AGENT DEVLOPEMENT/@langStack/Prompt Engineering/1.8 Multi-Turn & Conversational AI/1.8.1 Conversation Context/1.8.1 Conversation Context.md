| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.8.1.1 State Tracking]]** | Memory | Slots, key-value pairs, current status | "Knowing where you are" in a flow (e.g., Step 3 of 5) requires explicit state variables. |
| **[[1.8.1.2 History Management]]** | Logs | Message list, appending user/assistant turns | The raw log of "User said X, I said Y" is the bedrock of conversational AI. |
| **[[1.8.1.3 Context Window Rolling]]** | Limitations | Sliding window, truncation, summarization | Managing the limited attention span by carefully choosing which history to keep. |
| **[[1.8.1.4 Reference Resolution]]** | Pronouns | "It", "That", "The previous one", Anaphora | Understanding that "Buy *it*" refers to the product mentioned 3 turns ago. |
| **[[1.8.1.5 Topic Coherence]]** | Flow | Semantic consistency, staying on track | Ensuring the AI doesn't randomly switch topics unless prompted. |
| **[[1.8.1.6 Temporal Awareness]]** | Time | "Just now", "Earlier", relative time | Understanding temporal references within the conversation stream. |
| **[[1.8.1.7 Entity Persistence]]** | Facts | "My name is John", remembering user details | If the user introduces themselves in turn 1, the AI must know their name in turn 100. |
| **[[1.8.1.8 Context Restoration]]** | Sessions | Loading past chats, hydrology, "Welcome back" | Restoring the full mental state of a conversation after a user disconnection or time gap. |
| **[[1.8.1.9 Session Management]]** | Metadata | UserID, SessionID, timestamps | The engineering wrapper that allows multiple users to talk to the model simultaneously without crossing wires. |
| **[[1.8.1.10 Context Injection]]** | RAG | Inserting external data into the stream | Seamlessly weaving retrieved documents into the conversational history. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Conversation Context**, the memory that makes a chat a chat.
