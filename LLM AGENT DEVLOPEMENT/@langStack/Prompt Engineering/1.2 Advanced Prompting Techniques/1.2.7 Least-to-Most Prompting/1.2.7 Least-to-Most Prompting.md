# 1.2.7 Least-to-Most Prompting

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.2.7.1 Decomposition Strategy]]** | Problem breakdown | Sub-question generation, recursive logic, modular solving | Breaking a complex problem into a sequence of smaller, easier sub-problems makes the impossible possible. |
| **[[1.2.7.2 Sequential Solving]]** | Step-by-step chaining | Dependency management, linear execution, rigorous order | Solving sub-problems in order allows the answer to the first part to become the context for the second. |
| **[[1.2.7.3 Dynamic Context Append]]** | State building | Appending Q&A pairs, growing prompt, memory accumulation | As each sub-problem is solved, append the result to the prompt so the model "learns" as it goes. |
| **[[1.2.7.4 Handling Interdependencies]]** | Logic flow | Prerequisite identification, directed acyclic graph (DAG), linking | Identifying which sub-questions *must* be answered before others is critical for correct decomposition. |
| **[[1.2.7.5 Recursive Prompting]]** | Self-calling | Loop structures, depth management, terminating conditions | The model prompts itself with the next sub-question until the entire problem is resolved (like a `while` loop). |
| **[[1.2.7.6 When to Decompose]]** | Complexity threshold | Multi-hop reasoning, long documents, compound questions | Use Least-to-Most when a single CoT pass is overwhelming or when the problem has clear independent parts. |
| **[[1.2.7.7 Least-to-Most vs CoT]]** | Structure vs Flow | Strict modularity vs fluid narrative, structured output | CoT is a stream of consciousness; Least-to-Most is a structured project plan with distinct milestones. |
| **[[1.2.7.8 Reducing Token Window Pressure]]** | Efficiency | Segmented processing, partial loading, focused attention | By focusing on one sub-question at a time, the model doesn't need to attend to the entire complexity at once. |
| **[[1.2.7.9 Educational Applications]]** | Tutoring | Socratic method, scaffolding, guided learning | Least-to-Most mimics a tutor guiding a student through a hard problem one step at a time. |
| **[[1.2.7.10 Automating Decomposition]]** | Prompt engineering | Decomposer prompts, "List sub-questions", meta-prompting | A specialized "Decomposer Prompt" can automatically break down user queries before the solver starts. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Least-to-Most Prompting**, transforming overwhelming tasks into manageable steps.
