# 1.2.5 Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.2.5.1 ToT Architecture]]** | Search framework | Decomposition, Thought Generation, State Evaluation, Search Algorithm | ToT treats problem-solving as a tree search, generating multiple steps and evaluating them before proceeding. |
| **[[1.2.5.2 Thought Generators]]** | Proposing steps | "What are the next possible steps?", branching logic | The "Thought Generator" prompts the model to propose multiple valid next actions rather than just one. |
| **[[1.2.5.3 State Evaluators]]** | Valuing paths | Heuristic scoring, "Is this promising?", lookahead valuation | The "Evaluator" prompts the model to judge the potential of each proposed step (e.g., Sure/Likely/Impossible). |
| **[[1.2.5.4 Search Algorithms]]** | Navigation strategy | BFS (Breadth-First), DFS (Depth-First), Beam Search | You can navigate the tree of thoughts widely (BFS) or deeply (DFS) depending on the problem structure. |
| **[[1.2.5.5 Backtracking Mechanisms]]** | Error recovery | Pruning bad branches, returning to previous state, "Try again" | Unlike CoT (linear), ToT allows the model to realize a path is bad, stop, and backtrack to try a different branch. |
| **[[1.2.5.6 Implementing ToT]]** | Systems vs Prompts | Python control loop vs single-prompt simulation | ToT is usually a *system* (Python code looping calls), but can be simulated in a single complex prompt (Prompt-ToT). |
| **[[1.2.5.7 ToT for Creative Writing]]** | Exploratory generation | Plot branching, character decisions, multi-ending stories | ToT explores diverse plot lines (branches) and evaluates which ones are most interesting before continuing. |
| **[[1.2.5.8 ToT for Planning]]** | Strategic lookahead | Itinerary planning, code architecture, game state search | For tasks requiring long-term planning, ToT prevents "painting into a corner" by validating future viability. |
| **[[1.2.5.9 Resource Intensity]]** | High cost | Exponential tokens, complex orchestration, slow inference | ToT is extremely expensive and slow; use it only when linear CoT fails on hard reasoning tasks. |
| **[[1.2.5.10 Simplifying ToT (Prompt-based)]]** | Approximation | Structured prompting, "Explore 3 options then decide", single-turn | A lighter version asks the model to "list 3 possible approaches, critique them, and pick the best" in one go. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Tree-of-Thought**, enabling LLMs to solve problems requiring lookahead and backtracking.
