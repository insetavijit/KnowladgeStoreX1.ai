# 1.1.2 Prompt Anatomy

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.1.2.1 Role of System Messages]]** | Global behavior | System instructions, model identity, safety guardrails, tone setting | System messages set the foundational behavior, constraints, and personality of the LLM. |
| **[[1.1.2.2 User Messages & Intent]]** | Task specific | Query formulation, specific requests, user intent, task parameters | User messages provide the specific task or question the model needs to address. |
| **[[1.1.2.3 Assistant Messages & Few-Shot]]** | Output mirroring | Contextual examples, few-shot learning, historical responses, format anchoring | Assistant messages simulate previous outputs to guide the model's style and format. |
| **[[1.1.2.4 Instruction Placement]]** | Attention bias | Primacy effect, recency effect, instruction anchoring, "lost in the middle" | Placing instructions at the beginning or end of a prompt affects how well the model follows them. |
| **[[1.1.2.5 Delimiters & Formatting]]** | Context separation | XML tags, Markdown headers, triple quotes, clear boundaries | Delimiters clearly separate instructions from context to prevent instruction leakage or confusion. |
| **[[1.1.2.6 Context Structure]]** | Information hierarchy | Background data, reference material, priority ordering, noise reduction | Well-structured context helps the model distinguish relevant data from secondary information. |
| **[[1.1.2.7 Output Format Specification]]** | Deterministic output | JSON mode, XML tags, template adherence, schema forcing | Explicit format requests ensure the model produces parseable and predictable data structures. |
| **[[1.1.2.8 Prompt Templates & Variables]]** | Reusability | Dynamic injection, placeholders, template engines, reusable patterns | Templates allow for dynamic prompt generation by injecting variable data into pre-defined structures. |
| **[[1.1.2.9 Negative Constraints]]** | Boundary setting | "Do not" instructions, exclusion criteria, prohibited topics, style constraints | Negative constraints prevent unwanted behaviors or content by explicitly stating what to avoid. |
| **[[1.1.2.10 Multi-Message Chat Structure]]** | Dialogue state | Message history, turn-taking, context threading, conversation state | Chat structures manage the flow of multi-turn interactions through defined message roles. |

This table represents a **structured breakdown of Prompt Anatomy**, providing the foundational components required for building robust and reliable LLM prompts.
