# User Messages & Intent

**Core definition:** The **User Message** is the prompt component that conveys the specific input, question, or task for the current turn of the conversation. It represents the *variable* part of the interaction.

**Key idea:**

-   **Intent Driver:** The primary signal telling the model *what* to do.
-   **Dynamic Input:** Unlike the static System Message, this changes with every interaction.
-   **Payload Carrier:** usage often separates the "Instruction" (what to do) from the "Data" (what to process).

## Why It Matters

Even with a perfect System Message, a vague User Message will lead to poor results. The User Message must unambiguously bridge the gap between the user's mental goal and the model's action.

## Essential Functions

**1. Intent Declaration:**
*   "Summarize this text."
*   "Debug this code."
*   Clearly states the verb/action required.

**2. Data Provision:**
*   "Here is the article to summarize: [Text]..."
*   The raw material the model needs to work on.

**3. Specific Constraints (Local):**
*   "For *this* specific summary, focus only on financial details."
*   Overrides or refines global constraints for the immediate task.

## Anatomy of a Robust User Message

Avoid "naked" prompts. Structure the user message to separate intent from data.

**Bad:**
> Summarize this article I found on the web it's about AI and it says... [Text]

**Good (Structured):**
```text
### Instruction
Summarize the text below. Focus specifically on the new safety features mentioned.

### Input Text
"""
[Paste Article Here]
"""
```

## Intent Extraction

LLMs are "intent matching machines." To get the best output, your prompt should align with clear intents:

| Vague specific Intent | Clear Intent (Better) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Fix this." | "Identify the syntax error in line 42 and propose a fix." |
| "Write a blog post." | "Write a 500-word blog post about X for an audience of Y." |
| "What do you think?" | "Analyze the arguments in the text and list pros and cons." |

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Instruction-Data" Split**
Always separating commands from the content they operate on using delimiters (see 1.1.2.5).

**2. The "Fill-in-the-Blank"**
Providing a partial sentence for the model to complete.
*   User: "The capital of France is..."
*   Model: "Paris."

**3. The "Question-Context" Pair**
Providing background info alongside a question.
*   "Given the following financial report [Context], what was the Q3 revenue? [Question]"

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
The User Message is the specific request for the current turn. While the System Message sets the rules, the User Message sets the immediate task. Effective user messages clearly separate the *instruction* (the verb) from the *data* (the noun) to prevent confusion, especially when processing external text.

**One-line recall:**
**User Message = Clear Intent + Delimited Data.**
