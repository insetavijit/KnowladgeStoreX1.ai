# Negative Constraints

**Core definition:** **Negative Constraints** are instructions explicitly specifying what the model should **NOT** do, rather than what it should do. They set the "out of bounds" areas for behavior, content, or style.

**Key idea:**

-   **Exclusion:** Filtering out unwanted topics, formats, or styles.
-   **Safety:** Preventing dangerous or toxic outputs.
-   **Refinement:** Narrowing the solution space by blocking easy-but-wrong paths.

## Why It Matters

LLMs like to please. Without constraints, they may ramble, apologize excessively, or make up facts to fill silence. Telling the model what *not* to do is often as important as telling it what to do, especially for professional or strict outputs.

## Essential Utilities

**1. Style Constraints:**
*   "Do not apologize."
*   "Do not use flowery language."
*   "Do not begin with 'Here is the answer'."

**2. Content Constraints:**
*   "Do not mention competitors."
*   "Do not give medical advice."

**3. Format Constraints:**
*   "Do not include code comments."
*   "Do not output Markdown, only raw text."

## The "Pink Elephant" Problem

**Risk:** LLMs (and humans) struggle with pure negation. If you say "Do not think of a pink elephant," the attention mechanism focuses on "pink elephant."
**Solution:** Always pair a negative constraint with a positive alternative.

**Weak:**
> "Do not write long sentences."

**Strong:**
> "Do not write long sentences. Keep all sentences under 15 words."

## Anatomy of Effective Constraints

Constraints work best when grouped together, typically in the System Message or at the very end.

```text
[SYSTEM]
...
[CONSTRAINTS]
1. NO conversational filler (e.g., "Sure", "I hope this helps").
2. NO markdown formatting in the final output.
3. NEVER make up citation sources. If unknown, state "Unknown".
```

## Positive vs Negative Framing

| Goal | Negative Frame (Weaker) | Positive Frame (Stronger) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brevity** | "Don't be wordy." | "Be concise." |
| **Honesty** | "Don't lie." | "Only use provided facts." |
| **Code** | "Don't make bugs." | "Ensure code compiles." |

*Note: While positive is usually better, strictly "banning" specific tokens (like "Sorry" or "AI") is best done with a direct Negative Constraint.*

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Negative List"**
A numbered list of "forbidden acts" in the system prompt.

**2. The "Refusal Strategy"**
Instructing the model on how to *handle* the negative constraint.
"If asked about politics, do not answer. Instead, say: 'I cannot discuss this topic.'"

**3. "Stop Sequences" (Parameter)**
Using API parameters to hard-stop generation if a forbidden token/phrase appears (the ultimate negative constraint).

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Negative Constraints act as the guardrails for the LLM. They define the boundaries of acceptable output. While necessary for safety and style control, they should be used carefully. Over-using negatives can confuse the model; whenever possible, pair a "Don't do X" with a "Do Y instead" to give the model a clear path forward.

**One-line recall:**
**Negative Constraint = Explicit prohibition of unwanted behaviors.**
