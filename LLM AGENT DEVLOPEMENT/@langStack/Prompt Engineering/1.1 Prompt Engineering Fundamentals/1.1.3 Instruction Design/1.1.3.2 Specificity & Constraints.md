# Specificity & Constraints

**Core definition:** **Specificity** is the degree of detail provided in a prompt. **Constraints** are strict limitations placed on the model's output space. Together, they form the "box" in which the model operates.

**Key idea:**
-   **Detail Density:** The more specific details you provide, the narrower the solution space.
-   **Constraint Satisfaction:** LLMs are surprisingly good at following negative constraints ("Do not") and format constraints ("Must be under 50 words") if clearly stated.
-   **Holistic Control:** Specificity controls the *content*; Constraints control the *boundaries*.

## Why It Matters

A general prompt like "Write an email" relies entirely on the model's training data average (which is usually mediocre and generic). A specific prompt with constraints forces the model off the beaten path and into your exact requirements.

## Essential Utilities

**1. Length Constraints:**
*   "Maximum 50 words."
*   "Exactly 3 sentences."
*   "2 paragraphs, 5 lines each."

**2. Format Constraints:**
*   "Use a bulleted list."
*   "Format as a markdown table with columns A, B, C."
*   "No introduction or conclusion."

**3. Content Constraints:**
*   "Include the keywords: 'synergy', 'growth', 'Q4'."
*   "Do not mention any competitors."

**4. Style Constraints:**
*   "Write in the style of Hemingway."
*   "Use simple, valid HTML only."

## Anatomy of Specificity

**Weak:**
> Write a product description for a blender.

**Strong (Specific + Constrained):**
> Write a product description for the "BlitzMix 2000" high-speed blender.
> **Target Audience:** Health-conscious millennials.
> **Key Features to Highlight:** 1000W motor, quiet mode, dishwasher safe.
> **Constraints:**
> - Keep it under 100 words.
> - Use an energetic, punchy tone.
> - Do NOT use the word "smoothie" more than once.

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Must/Must-Not" List**
Explicitly listing requirements using strong modal verbs.
*   "You MUST include..."
*   "You MUST NOT mention..."

**2. The Reference Constraint**
"Use ONLY the provided text." (See Context Management).

**3. The Persona Constraint**
"Answer AS IF you are a lawyer." (Constrains vocabulary and tone).

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Specificity and Constraints are the steering wheel and brakes of the LLM. Specificity tells the model exactly where to go ("Drive to the post office via Main St"), while Constraints tell it what to avoid ("Don't go over 30mph, don't hit pedestrians"). Without them, you are essentially telling a taxi driver "Drive somewhere," which technically works but rarely gets you where you want to be.

**One-line recall:**
**Specificity = Detailed Map; Constraints = Guardrails.**
