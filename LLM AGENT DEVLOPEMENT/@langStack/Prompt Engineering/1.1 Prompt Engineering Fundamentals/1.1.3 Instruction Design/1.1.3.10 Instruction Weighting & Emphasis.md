# Instruction Weighting & Emphasis

**Core definition:** **Instruction Weighting** is the use of formatting, repetition, or capitalization to signal to the model which parts of the prompt are most critical (higher attention weight).

**Key idea:**
-   **Attention Mechanism:** The Transformer architecture "attends" to every token, but strong signals (like ALL CAPS or repetition) act as "attention magnets."
-   **Priority Conflict:** When two instructions conflict (e.g., "be detailed" vs "be short"), weighting tells the model which one wins.
-   **Visual Hierarchy:** Using headers and bullets mimics how humans read, which transfers to how models process structure.

## Why It Matters

In long prompts, models sometimes get "lazy" or forget secondary constraints. If a safety rule is buried in paragraph 4, it might be ignored. By artificially boosting its "visual volume" (Weighting), you ensure it stays top-of-mind for the model.

## Essential Utilities

**1. Capitalization (The "Shout"):**
"Do NOT ignore this."
(Use sparingly; too much creates noise).

**2. Repetition (The "Sandwich"):**
Stating the rule at the start *and* at the end.
"Remember: JSON only."

**3. Visual Delimiters:**
using `***` or `###` to draw attention.

**4. Labeling:**
"CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:"
"IMPORTANT:"

## Anatomy of Emphasis

**Flat Prompt (Low differentiation):**
> Please write a story. Make sure it's short. Don't use the letter 'e'. Keep it fun.

**Weighted Prompt (High differentiation):**
> Please write a fun story.
>
> **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
> DO NOT USE THE LETTER 'E'. This is the most important rule.
>
> *Length:* Keep it short.

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Must-Follow" Tag**
"Start your response with 'I understand'." (Forces acknowledgement).

**2. The Negative Reinforcement**
"If you fail to follow this rule, the system will break." (Simulating consequences boosts adherence in some models).

**3. The "Attention Pointer"**
"Pay special attention to the date in the second paragraph."

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Instruction Weighting is about controlling the "volume" of your prompt. You can whisper (implicit), talk (normal text), or scream (ALL CAPS + BOLD). Use weighting to build a hierarchy of importance, ensuring that your "dealbreaker" rules (safety, format) are louder than the "nice-to-have" preferences.

**One-line recall:**
**Weighting = Visual Volume Control.**
