# Explicit vs Implicit Guidance

**Core definition:** **Explicit Guidance** involves stating rules, formats, and expectations clearly in the text. **Implicit Guidance** relies on the model inferring expectations from examples (few-shot), tone, or context without direct instruction.

**Key idea:**
-   **Explicit is Safer:** For logic, restrictions, and formatting, "saying it" is better than "implying it."
-   **Implicit is Nuanced:** For style, tone, and creativity, "showing it" (examples) is often better than describing it.
-   **The Hybrid Approach:** The strongest prompts use Explicit instructions for *rules* and Implicit examples for *vibe*.

## Why It Matters

Relying on implicit guidance ("just figure it out from this example") is brittle. The model might latch onto the wrong feature of the example (e.g., copying the length but not the tone). Conversely, explicitly describing a complex style ("write in a neo-noir cyberpunk tone") is hard; showing an example is easier.

## Essential Utilities

**1. The "Rule Book" (Explicit):**
"Here are the 3 rules you must follow..."
(Best for JSON, hard constraints, safety).

**2. The "Style Reference" (Implicit):**
"Write a response that sounds like this transcript: [Text]."
(Best for voice, personality).

**3. The "Corrective" (Explicit):**
"Do NOT do what you usually do. Instead, do X."
(Overriding default implicit biases).

## Anatomy of Guidance

**Implicit Only (Risky for Logic):**
> Q: 2+2=4.
> Q: 3+3=6.
> Q: 10+10=
> *(Model guesses you want math).*

**Explicit Only (Hard for Style):**
> "Write a funny joke. It should be sarcastic, dry, but not mean, and involve a chicken."
> *(Model struggles to balance abstract adjectives).*

**Hybrid (Optimal):**
> **Instruction (Explicit):** "Write a dry, sarcastic joke about a chicken."
> **Style Example (Implicit):** "Like this: 'Why did the chicken cross the road? To show the armadillo it could be done.'"

## Common Patterns

**1. "Show AND Tell"**
Give the instruction, then give an example that obeys it. Dual reinforcement.

**2. The "Meta-Explicit"**
"I am going to provide examples. These are for *style only*. The *facts* must come from your knowledge." (Clarifying what the implicit examples represent).

**3. Explicit Formatting**
Never rely on implicit formatting ("make it look like the example"). Always explicitly say "Format as a table."

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
If it's a rule (don't lie, use JSON, be short), make it **Explicit**. If it's a feeling (be cool, sound professional, write code like a senior dev), use **Implicit** examples (few-shot). Examples are great for teaching pattern recognition, but instructions are necessary for enforcing laws. Use both.

**One-line recall:**
**Explicit for Rules; Implicit for Style.**
