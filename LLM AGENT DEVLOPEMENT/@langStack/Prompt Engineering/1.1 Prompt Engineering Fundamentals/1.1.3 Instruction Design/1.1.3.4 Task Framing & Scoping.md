# Task Framing & Scoping

**Core definition:** **Framing** is the act of setting the conceptual context or "mental model" for a task. **Scoping** is the act of defining the boundaries of what is included and excluded from that task.

**Key idea:**
-   **Priming:** How you introduce a problem changes how the model solves it. asking for a "critique" yields different results than asking for a "review."
-   **Boundary Setting:** Explicitly stating the scope prevents the model from doing too much (off-topic) or too little.
-   **Perspective Shift:** Framing allows you to rotate the problem (e.g., solve this from a business perspective vs. technical perspective).

## Why It Matters

LLMs are vast knowledge engines. If you ask "Explain Python," the scope is infinite. If you Frame it as "Explain Python for a customized Excel user," and Scope it to "only cover variables and loops," you get a useful answer. Without framing, you get generic encyclopedic content.

## Essential Utilities

**1. The "Role" Frame:**
"Act as a [Role]." (See Role-Based Prompting).
*   *Effect:* Activates specific vocabulary and prioritizing schemes.

**2. The "Goal" Frame:**
"Your goal is to [Win the argument / Find the truth / Broker a compromise]."
*   *Effect:* Changes the argumentative strategy.

**3. The "Audience" Scope:**
"Explain this for [Experts / Novices / Children]."
*   *Effect:* Adjusts complexity and tone.

## Anatomy of Framing

**Unframed Prompt:**
> "Is nuclear energy good?"

**Framed & Scoped Prompt:**
> "Analyze the viability of nuclear energy [Topic]...
> **Frame:** ...from the perspective of an environmental economist [Perspective].
> **Scope:** Focus ONLY on carbon emissions and cost per KWh [Boundaries]. Do not discuss safety or waste storage [Exclusions]."

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Scenario" Frame**
"Imagine you are in a shipwreck..." (Sets a simulation frame).

**2. The "Format" Scope**
"Your output must fit on a single index card." (Physical scoping).

**3. The "In-Context" Frame**
"In the context of 19th-century literature, interpret this sentence..." (Temporal/Domain scoping).

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Framing is about "setting the stage" before the actor speaks. It tells the model *how* to think about the problem. Scoping is about drawing the borders of the stage. It tells the model *where* to stop thinking. Together, they turn an open-ended question into a defined, solvable problem.

**One-line recall:**
**Framing = Perspective; Scoping = Boundaries.**
