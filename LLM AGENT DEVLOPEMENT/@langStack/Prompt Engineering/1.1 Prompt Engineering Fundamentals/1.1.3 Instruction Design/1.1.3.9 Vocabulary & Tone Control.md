# Vocabulary & Tone Control

**Core definition:** **Vocabulary Control** is constraining the specific words (lexicon) the model uses. **Tone Control** is constraining the emotional or professional "vibe" (register) of the output.

**Key idea:**
-   **Style Transfer:** LLMs are excellent mimics. They can adopt the voice of a pirate, a professor, or a corporate PR rep instantly.
-   **Vocabulary Level:** Adjusting the complexity of words (e.g., "explain for a 5-year-old") is the primary way to control readability.
-   **Brand Voice:** Consistent tone is essential for business applications to ensure the AI "sounds" like the company.

## Why It Matters

A correct answer with the wrong tone can be a failure. If a suicide hotline bot responds correctly but with a cheerful, emojis-filled tone, it's a disaster. If a legal bot uses slang, it loses credibility. Controlling *how* the model speaks is as important as controlling *what* it says.

## Essential Utilities

**1. Adjective Loading:**
"Be professional, concise, and objective." (Explicitly listing tone attributes).

**2. The "Persona" Anchor:**
"You are a grumpy old mechanic." (Implicitly sets vocabulary and tone).

**3. Negative Tone Constraints:**
"Do not be preachy." "Do not be overly enthusiastic." (Filtering unwanted vibes).

## Anatomy of Tone

| Target Tone | Prompt Keywords | Result Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Corporate** | "Professional", "Executive", "Formal" | No slang, passive voice, structured, polite. |
| **Gen Z / Casual** | "Casual", "Chatty", "Internet-native" | Emojis, lowercase, slang, short sentences. |
| **Academic** | "Scholarly", "Research-oriented", "Dry" | Complex vocabulary, citations, objective framing. |
| **EL5 (Simple)** | "Explain like I'm 5", "Simple English" | Short words, analogies, no jargon. |

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Voice Reference"**
"Write this in the style of [Author/Celebrity]."
*   "Write like Steve Jobs." (Short, punchy, visionary).

**2. The "Readability" Constraint**
"Use a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 8." (Technical constraint).

**3. The "Sentiment" Shift**
"Rewrite this angry email to be polite but firm." (Tone transformation).

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Vocabulary and Tone actions are the "wardrobe" of the LLM. You can dress the same answer in a tuxedo (Professional) or a hoodie (Casual). To master this, stop using generic words like "nice." Use specific style descriptors (concise, empathetic, rigorous, whimsical) or invoke specific personas to unlock the exact voice you need.

**One-line recall:**
**Tone = Persona + Vocabulary Constraints.**
