# Imperative vs Declarative Style

**Core definition:** **Imperative** prompts issue direct commands (**verbs**) telling the model *what to do*. **Declarative** prompts describe a state or situation (**nouns/adjectives**) hoping the model infers the correct action.

**Key idea:**
-   **Imperative = Action:** "Summarize this." "Translate this." (Stronger control).
-   **Declarative = Context:** "This is a summary." "A translation of the text." (Weaker control).
-   **Hybrid Power:** The best prompts often combine declarative context with imperative instructions.

## Why It Matters

LLMs like clear leadership. Passive, polite, or purely descriptive prompts ("It would be nice if you could...") often degrade performance because they increase the probability of "chatter" or refusal. Imperative commands ("DO THIS") cut through the noise and trigger the specific capabilities of the model.

## Essential Utilities

**1. Strong Verbs:**
Start instructions with an action verb.
*   *Weak:* "Can you maybe help me with..."
*   *Strong:* "**Analyze**...", "**Extract**...", "**Classify**...", "**Generate**..."

**2. Directness:**
Removing "politeness padding."
*   *Polite:* "I was wondering if you could please write a poem."
*   *Direct:* "Write a poem."

**3. State Description (Declarative):**
Used effectively for few-shot examples or persona setting.
*   "This is a list of high-quality examples:" (Declarative setup for few-shot).

## Anatomy of Style

| Style | Example | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Imperative** | "Translate to French." | High reliability, concise. | Can feel abrupt; less "creative". |
| **Declarative** | "Here is a French translation." | Good for specific completion tasks. | Model might continue the text instead of acting. |
| **Interrogative** | "Can you translate this?" | Natural for chat. | prone to "Yes I can" filler responses. |

## Common Patterns

**1. The "Command-First" Pattern**
Start the prompt with the imperative verb.
"**Summarize** the following text..."

**2. The Declarative Persona / Imperative Task**
"**You are** a helpful assistant. (Declarative) **Answer** this question. (Imperative)"

**3. The "Completer" Pattern (Declarative)**
Used for code completion or creative writing.
"The following is a Python function to calculate fibonacci:"
*(Model effectively auto-completes the code).*

## Quick Summaries

**30-second version:**
Stop asking the AI for favors and start giving it commands. Imperative prompts (Action Verbs) are the standard for engineering because they directly trigger the model's instruction-following heads. Declarative statements are useful for setting the scene (Context), but when it comes to the actual task, be a commander, not a requester.

**One-line recall:**
**Imperative = "Do X"; Declarative = "This is X"; Imperative wins for tasks.**
