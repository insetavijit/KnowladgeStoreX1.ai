# 1.1.4 Context Management

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.1.4.1 Context Window Limits]]** | Token constraints | Hard limits, sliding windows, token counting, truncation strategies | Understanding the exact capacity of the model prevents cutoff and data loss errors. |
| **[[1.1.4.2 Primacy & Recency Bias]]** | Information placement | "Lost in the Middle", beginning/end weighting, critical info positioning | Important instructions and headers should be at the start or end, as middle content is often forgotten. |
| **[[1.1.4.3 Context Delimiters]]** | Structural separation | XML tags, triple quotes, markdown headers, visual fences | Distinct separators like `<context>...</context>` help the model distinguish data from immediate instructions. |
| **[[1.1.4.4 Relevance & Signal-to-Noise]]** | Data quality | Filtering, pruning irrelevant text, high-density information | Flooding the context with irrelevant noise dilutes the model's attention and degrades performance. |
| **[[1.1.4.5 Reference-Based Answering]]** | Grounding | "Answer from text only", citation requirements, hallucination checks | Forcing the model to explicitly reference the provided context reduces external hallucinations. |
| **[[1.1.4.6 Dynamic Context Injection]]** | Automating context | Template variables, RAG integration points, metadata inclusion | Dynamically inserting user-specific data into a static prompt structure enables personalized scale. |
| **[[1.1.4.7 Context Pruning & Summarization]]** | Token efficiency | Abstractive summarization, key-point extraction, redundancy removal | Compressing context before sending it to the model saves cost and improves focus on essential facts. |
| **[[1.1.4.8 Handling Long-Form Content]]** | Overflow management | Chunking strategies, map-reduce, iterative processing | Deeply analyzing documents larger than the context window requires breaking them into logical segments. |
| **[[1.1.4.9 System vs User Context]]** | Role placement | System message grounding, persistent rules vs ephemeral data | Fundamental context rules belong in the System message, while dynamic data belongs in the User message. |
| **[[1.1.4.10 Structured Data Context]]** | Format parsing | JSON injection, CSV data, schema definitions | LLMs parse structured data (JSON/CSV) as context more accurately than unstructured paragraphs. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Context Management**, designed to ensure models have the right information at the right time for accurate generation.
