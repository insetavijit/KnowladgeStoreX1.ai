# 1.11.1 GPT-4 Optimization

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.11.1.1 Handling Verbosity]]** | Output control | "Be brief", "No preamble", negative constraints | GPT-4 loves to talk; optimization often means telling it to shut up and just give the answer. |
| **[[1.11.1.2 Complexity Handling]]** | Reasoning | Deep chain-of-thought, nuance detection | GPT-4 excels at tasks where other models fail; use it for the hard stuff, not the easy stuff. |
| **[[1.11.1.3 Cost/Quality Trade-off]]** | Economics | Token price, slower inference, ROI | GPT-4 is expensive and slow; only use it when the cost of being wrong is higher than the API bill. |
| **[[1.11.1.4 Vision Capabilities]]** | Multimodal | GPT-4V, image inputs, diagram understanding | Leveraging the unique ability to "see" charts and UIs as part of the prompt. |
| **[[1.11.1.5 Function Calling Native]]** | Tooling | Tool definitions, parameters, robust extraction | GPT-4 is the best model for reliably calling functions without hallucinates syntax. |
| **[[1.11.1.6 128k Context Usage]]** | Memory | RAG, document analysis, needle in haystack | Using the massive context window effectively (but knowing that retrieval reliability drops in the middle). |
| **[[1.11.1.7 System Prompt Nuance]]** | Instruction | Role adherence, strong constraints | GPT-4 follows system prompts better than any other model; put your critical rules there. |
| **[[1.11.1.8 JSON Mode]]** | Formatting | `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` | Forcing valid JSON output natively (a specific feature of the OpenAI API). |
| **[[1.11.1.9 Seed Parameter]]** | Reproducibility | Deterministic outputs, testing | Using the `seed` parameter to get consistent results for regression testing. |
| **[[1.11.1.10 When NOT to use GPT-4]]** | Selection | summarization, simple classification, speed | Don't use a Ferrari to drive to the mailbox; use GPT-3.5 or Llama for simple tasks. |

This table represents a **complete guide to GPT-4**, the King of the Hill (for now).
