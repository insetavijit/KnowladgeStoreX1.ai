# 1.11.8 Vision-Language Models

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.11.8.1 Image Captioning]]** | Description | "Describe this image", Alt-text generation | The most basic VLM task: turing pixels into words. |
| **[[1.11.8.2 Visual Question Answering]]** | VQA | "Where is the cat?", "What color is the car?" | Asking questions about the content of an image. |
| **[[1.11.8.3 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)]]** | Text | Reading receipts, handwriting, signs | Extracting text from images (VLMs are often better than traditional OCR). |
| **[[1.11.8.4 Spatial Reasoning]]** | Position | "Is the cup to the left of the laptop?", bounding boxes | Understanding the physical relationship between objects. |
| **[[1.11.8.5 Multi-Image Comparison]]** | Diffing | "What changed between these two photos?" | Spot the difference, satellite imagery analysis. |
| **[[1.11.8.6 Chart & Graph Analysis]]** | Data | "Summarize the trend in this plot", data extraction | Reading financial charts or scientific plots directly. |
| **[[1.11.8.7 Video Understanding]]** | Time | Frame sampling, temporal reasoning | Analyzing video by breaking it down into a sequence of image frames. |
| **[[1.11.8.8 Prompting with Images]]** | Input | One-shot visual prompting, "Make it look like this" | Using an image as the *instruction* (e.g., style reference). |
| **[[1.11.8.9 Visual Hallucinations]]** | Error | Seeing things that aren't there | VLMs can hallucinate objects just like LLMs hallucinate facts. |
| **[[1.11.8.10 Resolution & Tokens]]** | Cost | High-res vs Low-res, token cost calculation | "High Res" mode costs more tokens; knowing when you need it vs when low res works. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Vision-Language Models**, giving the brain some eyes.
