# 1.11.2 GPT-3.5 Optimization

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.11.2.1 Speed Maximization]]** | Performance | Latency, real-time chat, instant response | GPT-3.5 is fast; prompt it to be concise to make it even faster. |
| **[[1.11.2.2 Concise Instructions]]** | Clarity | Short prompts, direct commands, less nuance | GPT-3.5 gets confused by long, rambling prompts; keep it simple and direct. |
| **[[1.11.2.3 Handling Hallucinations]]** | Reality check | Fact checking, grounding, temperature=0 | GPT-3.5 hallucinates more than GPT-4; you need stronger guardrails and verification. |
| **[[1.11.2.4 "Think Step-by-Step" Necessity]]** | Reasoning | CoT, explicit guidance | You *must* tell GPT-3.5 to think step-by-step for math/logic; GPT-4 might do it automatically, but 3.5 needs the nudge. |
| **[[1.11.2.5 Formatting rigidity]]** | Output | Examples, few-shot, whitespace | It needs more examples (few-shot) to get the format right compared to smarter models. |
| **[[1.11.2.6 Context Limitations]]** | Memory | 16k context, forgetting, summarization | You have less room to play; strict context management is required. |
| **[[1.11.2.7 Cost Efficiency]]** | Budget | High volume, background tasks, classification | The workhorse model: perfect for processing millions of rows of data cheaply. |
| **[[1.11.2.8 Simple Tasks]]** | Selection | Sentiment analysis, summarization, extraction | Use it for mechanical tasks where "reasoning" isn't required. |
| **[[1.11.2.9 Fallback Usage]]** | Architecture | "If GPT-4 fails...", backup handler | Using 3.5 as a backup or for the "easy" routing path. |
| **[[1.11.2.10 Fine-tuning Candidate]]** | Optimization | Custom models, style transfer | GPT-3.5 is the primary candidate for fine-tuning; a fine-tuned 3.5 often beats raw GPT-4. |

This table represents a **complete guide to GPT-3.5**, the reliable workhorse.
