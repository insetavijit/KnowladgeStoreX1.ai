# 1.11.7 Function Calling

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.11.7.1 Tool Definitions (JSON Schema)]]** | Interface | `tools` parameter, OpenAPI spec | Telling the model *what* it can do by defining functions like `get_weather(location)`. |
| **[[1.11.7.2 Argument Parsing]]** | Extraction | Extracting `location="London"` from "What's the weather in London?" | The core magic: turning natural language into structured API calls. |
| **[[1.11.7.3 Zero-Shot Tool Use]]** | Capability | figuring out which tool to use without examples | A smart model knows to use the calculator tool for math without being told explicitly. |
| **[[1.11.7.4 Parallel Function Calling]]** | Efficiency | Calling 5 functions at once | "Get weather for NY, London, and Tokyo" -> 3 parallel API calls, not 3 serial ones. |
| **[[1.11.7.5 Handling API Errors]]** | Robustness | "Tool failed, retry", feeding errors back to LLM | If the code errors, showing the error message to the LLM so it can fix the arguments and retry. |
| **[[1.11.7.6 Hallucinated Functions]]** | Error | Calling `get_weather_forecast` when only `get_current_weather` exists | Models sometimes invent functions that you didn't give them; explicit constraints are needed. |
| **[[1.11.7.7 Parameter Validation]]** | Safety | Type checking, sanitization | Never trust the arguments the LLM gives you; validate them before running. |
| **[[1.11.7.8 Recursive Tool Use]]** | Agents | Tool calling tool, reasoning loops | An agent that uses a search tool, reads the result, then uses a calculator tool. |
| **[[1.11.7.9 Conversation Loop]]** | State | User -> LLM -> Function -> LLM -> User | The "sandwich" pattern where the function execution happens invisible to the user. |
| **[[1.11.7.10 Security limits]]** | Safety | Read-only vs Write access, human approval | Don't give an LLM a `delete_database()` function without a human confirmation step. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Function Calling**, giving the brain some hands.
