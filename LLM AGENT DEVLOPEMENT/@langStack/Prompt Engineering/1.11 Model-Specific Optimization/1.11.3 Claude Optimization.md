# 1.11.3 Claude Optimization

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.11.3.1 XML Tag Preference]]** | Syntax | `<tags>`, structured input, clear delimiters | Claude *loves* XML; using `<instruction>` and `<context>` tags drastically improves its performance. |
| **[[1.11.3.2 200k Context Windows]]** | Research | "Needle in haystack", huge documents | Claude generally handles massive context (books, codebases) better/cheaper than GPT-4. |
| **[[1.11.3.3 Constitutional AI Traits]]** | Safety | HHH, refusal, preachy-ness | Claude is more likely to refuse "harmful" prompts; you need to understand its safety baseline to navigate it. |
| **[[1.11.3.4 Prompt Caching]]** | Efficiency | Cache headers, cost savings, reuse | Anthropic's unique feature: caching huge context prefixes so you don't pay to re-send them (huge cost saver). |
| **[[1.11.3.5 Refusal Handling]]** | Steering | "Skip the preamble", "Do not apologize" | Claude loves to apologize; instructing it to be direct is standard boilerplate. |
| **[[1.11.3.6 Artifacts Usage]]** | UI | Generating code/docs in separate windows | (Claude.ai specific) Leveraging the Artifacts UI for generating clean, standalone content. |
| **[[1.11.3.7 Sycophancy Reduction]]** | Honesty | "Don't agree with me", bias checking | Claude can be too agreeable; tell it to be objective. |
| **[[1.11.3.8 Pre-filling Assistant Response]]** | Control | "Start your answer with: {", JSON forcing | The #1 trick for Claude: putting the first few characters of the desired output into the API call forces it to comply. |
| **[[1.11.3.9 Chain of Thought Enforcement]]** | Logic | `<thinking>` tags, `stop_sequences` | Explicitly asking Claude to write its thinking process in XML tags, then hiding them from the user. |
| **[[1.11.3.10 Haiku vs Opus]]** | Selection | Speed vs Smarts hierarchy | Haiku is blazing fast (3.5 competitor), Opus is genius (GPT-4 competitor). |
