| **[[1.2.5 Tuples & Named Tuples]]**           | Create and work with ordered immutable sequences      | tuples are immutable, ordered, allow duplicates; hashable; memory efficient                     | Tuples provide immutable ordered collections.                           |
| **[[Tuple Creation]]**                        | Create tuple objects with various syntax              | parentheses (), comma operator, tuple() constructor                                             | Tuples are created with parentheses or comma.                           |
| **[[Tuple Unpacking & Packing]]**             | Extract and bundle values to/from tuples              | unpacking syntax, extended unpacking, *args pattern, multiple assignment                       | Unpacking extracts values; packing bundles them into tuples.            |
| **[[Immutability Benefits]]**                 | Understand advantages of unchangeable tuples          | hashability, use as dict keys, thread safety, documentation intent                             | Immutability enables use as dictionary keys and ensures data integrity. |
| **[[Namedtuple for Readable Tuples]]**        | Create tuples with named fields for clarity           | namedtuple() factory, field access by name, default values, _fields attribute                  | Namedtuples add field names for better code readability.               |
| **[[Tuple Methods]]**                         | Query tuple content                                    | count(), index(), length, iteration                                                            | Tuple methods provide read-only access operations.                     |
| **[[When to Use Tuples vs Lists]]**           | Decide between tuple and list data structures         | performance, immutability requirement, hashability, API expectations                           | Use tuples for immutable, hashable collections; lists for mutable data.|
