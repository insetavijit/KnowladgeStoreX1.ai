| **[[1.2.7 Sets & Set Operations]]**           | Work with unordered collections of unique values      | sets are unordered, mutable, no duplicates; hashable elements only                              | Sets enable efficient unique element collections.                    |
| **[[Set Creation]]**                          | Create set objects with various methods               | literal syntax {}, set() constructor, set comprehensions                                        | Sets are created with braces or set() constructor.                   |
| **[[Set Operations]]**                        | Perform mathematical operations on sets               | union (|), intersection (&), difference (-), symmetric difference (^), subset/superset          | Set operations perform mathematical logic on element groups.          |
| **[[Set Comprehensions]]**                    | Create sets using compact syntax with conditions      | syntax {x for ... if ...}, conditional filtering, deduplication                                 | Comprehensions build sets concisely while removing duplicates.        |
| **[[Frozenset]]**                             | Create immutable sets for hashability                 | frozenset(), immutability benefits, use as dict keys or in other sets                           | Frozensets provide immutable sets suitable for hashing.               |
| **[[Membership Testing]]**                    | Check if elements exist in sets                       | `in` operator, efficient O(1) lookup, iteration, count                                          | Membership testing checks element presence efficiently.               |
| **[[Duplicate Removal]]**                     | Eliminate duplicate elements from collections         | set() conversion, performance benefits, data deduplication                                      | Sets automatically eliminate duplicates.                              |
| **[[Set Theory Applications]]**               | Apply mathematical set concepts in programs           | venn diagrams, filtering, deduplication, relationship analysis                                  | Set operations solve real-world grouping and relationship problems.   |
