|---|---|
|**[[1.2.1.6 Type Hints (PEP 484)]]**|Type hints provide optional annotations that describe the intended types of variables, parameters, and return values.|
|**[[Annotation Syntax]]**|Type information is expressed using annotations such as `x: int` and `def f() -> str`, without affecting runtime behavior.|
|**[[Static Analysis]]**|Type hints enable external tools to perform static type checking, error detection, and code validation prior to execution.|
|**[[Runtime Neutrality]]**|Python does not enforce type hints at runtime; they serve as metadata rather than constraints.|
|**[[Optional Typing]]**|Hints may be partially applied or omitted entirely, allowing gradual typing in large codebases.|
|**[[Documentation Benefit]]**|Annotations act as machine-readable documentation, improving code comprehension and maintainability.|
|**[[Tooling Ecosystem]]**|Linters, IDEs, and type checkers leverage PEP 484 to enhance developer feedback and refactoring safety.|
|**[[Design Philosophy]]**|PEP 484 balances Python’s dynamic nature with static reasoning, emphasizing clarity over enforcement.|
