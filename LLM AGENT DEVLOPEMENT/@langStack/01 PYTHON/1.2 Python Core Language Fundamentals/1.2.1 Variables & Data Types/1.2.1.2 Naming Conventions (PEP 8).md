| **Concept**                         | **Brief**                                                                            |

| **[[snake_case]]**                  | Variable and function names use lowercase letters with underscores for readability.  |
| **[[Descriptive Names]]**           | Names should clearly express intent and meaning rather than using abbreviations.     |
| **[[Avoiding Keywords]]**           | Python reserved keywords must not be used as identifiers to prevent syntax errors.   |
| **[[Constants]] (`UPPER_CASE`)**    | Constants are conventionally written in uppercase to signal immutability by intent.  |
| **[[Case Sensitivity]]**            | Python treats differently cased names as distinct identifiers (`value` ≠ `Value`).   |
| **[[Single vs Double Underscore]]** | Leading underscores indicate internal use; double underscores trigger name mangling. |
| **[[PEP 8 Compliance]]**            | Following PEP 8 ensures consistency, maintainability, and professional code style.   |
