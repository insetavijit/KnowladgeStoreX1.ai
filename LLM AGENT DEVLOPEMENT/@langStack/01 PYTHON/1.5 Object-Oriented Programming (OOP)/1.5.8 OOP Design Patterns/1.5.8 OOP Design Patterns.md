| **[[1.5.8 OOP Design Patterns]]**              | Apply proven OOP design patterns in code              | pattern reuse, proven solutions, architecture                                                    | Design patterns provide proven solutions to recurring problems.      |
| **[[Singleton Pattern]]**                      | Ensure only one instance of a class exists            | single instance creation, instance reuse, global access                                          | Singleton ensures a class has only one instance.                     |
| **[[Factory Pattern]]**                        | Create objects without specifying concrete classes    | object creation abstraction, polymorphic creation, encapsulation                                  | Factory pattern abstracts object creation.                           |
| **[[Builder Pattern]]**                        | Construct complex objects step-by-step                | step-by-step construction, fluent interface, configuration                                       | Builder pattern constructs complex objects incrementally.            |
| **[[Observer Pattern]]**                       | Implement publish-subscribe behavior                  | event handling, loose coupling, observer registration                                            | Observer pattern enables publish-subscribe communication.            |
| **[[Strategy Pattern]]**                       | Switch between different algorithms at runtime        | algorithm selection, behavior variation, algorithm encapsulation                                  | Strategy pattern encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.            |
| **[[SOLID Principles Application]]**           | Apply SOLID principles in OOP design                  | Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion          | SOLID principles guide effective OOP design.                         |
| **[[Composition Over Inheritance]]**           | Prefer composition for code reuse                     | composition benefits, inheritance drawbacks, flexibility improvement                             | Composition often provides more flexibility than inheritance.        |
| **[[Design Pattern Best Practices]]**          | Use patterns appropriately and avoid overuse          | pattern selection, avoiding premature use, recognizing appropriate contexts                      | Use design patterns to solve real problems, not hypothetical ones.   |
