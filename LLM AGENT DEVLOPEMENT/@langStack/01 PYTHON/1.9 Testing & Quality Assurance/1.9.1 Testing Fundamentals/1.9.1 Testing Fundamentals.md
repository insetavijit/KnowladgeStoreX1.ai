| **[[1.9.1 Testing Fundamentals]]**             | Understand testing principles and strategies           | quality assurance, defect prevention, software reliability                                        | Testing ensures code quality and correctness.                        |
| **[[Testing Pyramid]]**                        | Understand optimal test distribution                   | unit tests (base), integration tests (middle), E2E tests (top), cost-benefit                      | Pyramid shows optimal test distribution.                             |
| **[[Unit vs Integration vs E2E Tests]]**       | Distinguish testing levels                             | unit tests isolated units, integration tests components, E2E full workflows                       | Unit tests small units; E2E tests complete flows.                    |
| **[[Test Coverage Concepts]]**                 | Measure code covered by tests                          | coverage percentage, branch coverage, coverage limits                                             | Coverage measures tested code percentage.                            |
| **[[TDD (Test-Driven Development)]]**          | Write tests before code                                | red-green-refactor cycle, test-first design, code quality                                         | TDD writes tests before implementation.                              |
| **[[BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)]]**      | Specify behavior in tests                              | scenario-based testing, Gherkin syntax, business language                                         | BDD uses business language for specifications.                       |
| **[[Testing Principles]]**                     | Follow testing best practices                          | isolation, repeatability, clarity, speed, independence                                           | Principles guide effective test design.                              |
| **[[Testing Philosophy]]**                     | Adopt testing mindset                                  | quality culture, prevention over detection, testing value                                         | Testing philosophy prioritizes quality.                              |
