Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.2.7 State Persistence]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.2.7.1 State Persistence Overview]]**|Durable state storage|persistence, checkpointing, state storage, durable state|State persistence saves graph state to durable storage for recovery and resumption.|
|**[[1.2.7.2 Checkpointer Systems]]**|Checkpointing infrastructure|checkpointers, checkpoint interface, checkpoint system, state snapshots|Checkpointers provide the infrastructure for saving and loading graph state snapshots.|
|**[[1.2.7.3 MemorySaver Basics]]**|In-memory checkpointing|MemorySaver, in-memory storage, temporary persistence, development checkpointing|MemorySaver stores checkpoints in memory, suitable for development and single-process use.|
|**[[1.2.7.4 SqliteSaver]]**|SQLite persistence|SqliteSaver, SQLite database, file-based persistence, local storage|SqliteSaver persists state to SQLite databases, providing file-based durable storage.|

|**[[1.2.7.7 Loading State]]**|Reading checkpoints|load operations, checkpoint retrieval, state deserialization, checkpoint reads|Loading state retrieves checkpoints from storage and deserializes state for resumption.|
|**[[1.2.7.8 Resuming Execution]]**|Continuing from checkpoints|resume, checkpoint resumption, state restoration, execution continuation|Resuming execution loads saved state and continues graph execution from checkpoint point.|
|**[[1.2.7.9 State Versioning]]**|Checkpoint versions|versioning, checkpoint versions, state evolution, migration|State versioning tracks checkpoint schema evolution and enables state migration strategies.|
|**[[1.2.7.10 Custom Checkpointers]]**|Implementing checkpointers|custom checkpointers, checkpoint interface, specialized storage, custom persistence|Custom checkpointers enable persistence to specialized storage systems or custom formats.|
|**[[1.2.7.11 Persistence Performance]]**|Storage efficiency|persistence overhead, storage performance, checkpoint frequency, optimization|Persistence has overhead; balance checkpoint frequency with performance requirements.|
|**[[1.2.7.12 Persistence Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready persistence|appropriate storage, checkpoint strategy, error handling, cleanup|Choose appropriate storage, implement checkpoint strategy, handle errors, and manage storage cleanup.|
