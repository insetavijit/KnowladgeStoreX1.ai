|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Installation & Environment Setup**|Demonstrate the ability to set up LangGraph in a development environment from scratch.|Python version requirements; package managers; virtual environments; dependency management.|Proper setup ensures LangGraph runs reliably in your environment.|
|**[[Python Version Requirements]]**|State minimum and recommended Python versions for LangGraph.|Python 3.9+; compatibility with 3.10, 3.11, 3.12; deprecation notes; edge cases.|Check Python version before installing LangGraph.|
|**[[Virtual Environment Setup]]**|Explain best practices for isolating project dependencies.|venv, virtualenv, pyenv; activation; deactivation; cross-platform compatibility.|Always work in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.|
|**[[Poetry vs pip Installation]]**|Compare dependency management tools and their tradeoffs.|pip + requirements.txt; poetry for reproducibility; uv for speed; lock files; dev dependencies.|Poetry ensures consistent reproducible builds across machines.|
|**[[Installing LangGraph]]**|Walk through the actual installation command and verify it works.|`pip install langgraph`; version pinning; optional extras; upgrades; uninstall.|`pip install langgraph` brings in core framework and dependencies.|
|**[[LangChain Dependency Installation]]**|Explain installing LangChain alongside LangGraph.|`pip install langchain`; version compatibility; separate installs; integration modules.|LangGraph requires LangChain as a peer dependency.|
|**[[Optional Dependencies]]**|Describe advanced packages for specific features.|Redis for checkpointing; playwright for web tools; anthropic/openai SDKs; database adapters.|Optional packages unlock advanced LangGraph features like persistence.|
|**[[Development Environment Setup]]**|Show how to prepare for coding and debugging.|IDE setup (VS Code, PyCharm); debugger configuration; REPL/Jupyter; requirements-dev.txt.|Use an IDE with debugging for faster iteration on graphs.|
|**[[API Key Management]]**|Demonstrate secure handling of API credentials.|Environment variables (.env files); dotenv package; secrets management; avoiding hardcoding.|Store API keys in .env files, never in source code.|
|**[[Testing Environment]]**|Prepare an isolated space for unit and integration tests.|pytest setup; fixtures; mocking LLM calls; test data; CI/CD integration.|Test environments validate graphs before production deployment.|
|**[[Dependency Management & Conflicts]]**|Handle version incompatibilities and dependency resolution.|pip list; pip check; dependency trees; pinning versions; managing conflicts.|Monitor dependency versions to prevent runtime surprises.|
|**[[Upgrading LangGraph]]**|Manage version updates and breaking changes safely.|Checking current version; semantic versioning; release notes; migration guides; rollback.|Read release notes before upgrading to understand breaking changes.|
|**[[Environment-Specific Configuration]]**|Tailor setup for local development, staging, and production.|Config files; environment variables for different stages; local vs cloud; secrets rotation.|Use environment variables to switch configs without code changes.|
|**[[Troubleshooting Installation Issues]]**|Solve common setup problems and verify a working install.|Broken dependencies; pip cache; wheel compilation; platform issues; connectivity problems.|Run `python -c "import langgraph"` to verify successful installation.|
|**[[Docker & Containerization]]**|Build isolated reproducible environments for consistency and deployment.|Dockerfile; Docker Compose; image layers; volume mounts; orchestration.|Containers ensure identical environments from dev to production.|
|**[[Validating the Setup]]**|Confirm that all tools are correctly installed and functional.|Import checks; version checks; simple script execution; connectivity tests; basic graph creation.|A working setup allows importing langgraph with no errors.|
