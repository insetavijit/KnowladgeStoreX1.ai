Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.6.11 Pattern Composition]]**, covering combining patterns into complex workflows.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Pattern Composition Overview**|Explain combining simple patterns into complex workflows.**Composition; nesting; pattern combination; layering; sophisticated patterns; modularity; building blocks; complex from simple.**Pattern composition: simple patterns combine to create sophisticated workflows; modularity enables reuse and maintainability.|
|**[[Linear → Branching Composition]]**|Show adding branching to linear workflow.**Linear base; add branching; linear then branch; multiple paths; complexity addition; progressive enhancement; pattern augmentation.**Build on linear workflow: add conditional edge; branch to multiple nodes; converts linear to branching pattern.**
|**[[Branching → Looping Composition]]**|Describe loops within branches for complex control.**Loop in branches; loop within branch; iteration scope; localized iteration; complex looping; nested looping; loop placement.**Add looping: within each branch, add internal loop; iterations scoped to that branch; enables sophisticated control.**
|**[[Linear + Retry Composition]]**|Show adding retry logic to linear workflow.**Linear with retry; fault tolerance; error recovery; resilient linear; retry on failure; error handling addition; robustness addition.**Wrap linear workflow nodes with retry logic; each node can retry on failure; improves reliability; resilience pattern.**
|**[[Agent as Pattern Building Block]]**|Explain agents as reusable pattern components.**Agent pattern; agent as component; agent sub-pattern; modular agent; reusable agent; agent integration; pattern within pattern.**Agent pattern (think-act-observe loop) itself is a reusable pattern; use as sub-pattern within larger workflows; modular.**
|**[[Sequential Agents (Chained Thinking)]]**|Show multiple agents in sequence for progressive refinement.**Sequential agents; agent chaining; progressive refinement; multi-stage reasoning; specialist agents; agent cooperation; sequential reasoning.**Chain multiple agents: each agent refines output of previous; enables multi-stage reasoning; specialist delegation pattern.**
|**[[Conditional Agent Selection]]**|Describe routing to different agents based on input.**Agent routing; agent selection; conditional agent; specialized agents; router; multiple agents; agent dispatcher; specialized routing.**Route to specialized agent based on problem type: routing node selects best agent for task; enables specialization.**
|**[[Parallel Agents with Merge]]**|Show running agents in parallel and combining results.**Parallel agents; agent pool; parallel reasoning; concurrent agents; result merging; voting; combined inference; parallel reasoning.**Run multiple agents in parallel; each provides solution; merge results (voting, consensus); improves quality.|
|**[[Feedback Loops (Reflection Pattern)]]**|Describe agents reviewing and improving their own output.**Self-refinement; reflection; self-correction; feedback loop; output review; improvement iteration; agent introspection; quality improvement.**Agent generates output, reviews own output, improves; reflection loop; enables self-refinement within agent loop.**
|**[[Nested Loops (Multi-Level Iteration)]]**|Show loops within loops for multi-level problems.**Nested loops; outer loop; inner loop; hierarchical iteration; levels of iteration; scoped iteration; hierarchical control.**Implement nested loops: outer loop for high-level iteration, inner loops for sub-problems; enables hierarchical iteration.**
|**[[State-Based Pattern Switching]]**|Describe selecting different patterns based on state.**Pattern switching; dynamic pattern; state-driven pattern; pattern selection; pattern routing; adaptive pattern; dynamic choice.**Use state to select pattern: if simple_problem → use simple_pattern, if complex_problem → use complex_pattern; adaptive.**
|**[[Pattern Abstraction via Subgraphs]]**|Show composing subgraphs as reusable pattern units.**Subgraphs; encapsulation; abstraction; modular patterns; reusable units; composition; hierarchical graphs; abstraction layers.**Encapsulate pattern in subgraph: reuse as unit; improves modularity; enables hierarchical composition; clean interfaces.**
|**[[Composing Retries with Agent Loops]]**|Describe combining retry logic with agent loops.**Retries in agents; agent retry; loop with retries; error recovery within loop; resilient agents; error handling in loops; robust iteration.**Add retry logic within agent loop: on tool failure, retry tool call; agent continues; improves failure recovery within loops.**
|**[[Testing Composed Patterns]]**|Describe testing complex composed patterns.**Testing; integration testing; composition testing; component interaction testing; whole system testing; thorough testing; verification strategy.**Test composed patterns: verify each sub-pattern works, test composition integration, test end-to-end; comprehensive verification.**
|**[[Documentation of Complex Compositions]]**|Explain documenting composed pattern workflows.**Documentation; pattern documentation; composition documentation; architecture documentation; clarity; understanding; knowledge transfer.**Document complex compositions: explain pattern choices, show structure, document data flow, explain design decisions; team understanding.**
|**[[Iterative Refinement of Compositions]]**|Show evolving patterns as requirements change.**Refactoring; refinement; evolution; requirements change; pattern improvement; iterative development; continuous improvement; pattern growth.**Start with simple composition; refactor as needs evolve; add complexity incrementally; avoid over-engineering from start.|

Finally, we'll cover **[[1.1.6.12 Pattern Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**.
