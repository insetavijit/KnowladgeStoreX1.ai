Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.6.1 Simple Graph Patterns Overview]]**, covering common workflow structures.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Simple Graph Patterns Overview**|Explain what patterns are and why they matter in LangGraph.**Patterns; reusable structures; workflow templates; design patterns; architectural patterns; common solutions; pattern use; pattern benefits.**Patterns are reusable workflow structures that solve common LangGraph problems; reduce development time.|
|**[[Why Patterns Matter]]**|Describe the benefits of using established patterns.**Code reuse; maintainability; clarity; testing; best practices; proven solutions; quality; confidence; pattern adoption.**Patterns provide proven solutions; improve code clarity; reduce bugs; enable team consistency; speed development.|
|**[[Pattern Categories]]**|Show the main categories of LangGraph patterns.**Linear patterns; branching; looping; retry; agent; composite; basic; advanced; categorization; taxonomy.**Main categories: linear, branching, looping, retry, agent patterns; each solves different problems.|
|**[[Pattern vs Anti-Pattern]]**|Explain the difference between patterns and anti-patterns.**Patterns; anti-patterns; good practices; bad practices; what to do; what to avoid; distinction; guidance; learning.**Patterns are best practices; anti-patterns are common mistakes; learn both to build well and avoid pitfalls.**
|**[[Composing Patterns]]**|Describe building complex workflows from simple patterns.**Pattern composition; nesting; building blocks; complexity; modularity; nesting patterns; structure building; combination.**Combine simple patterns to build complex workflows; nest patterns within patterns for sophisticated behavior.|
|**[[Pattern Complexity Tradeoff]]**|Show when to use simple vs complex patterns.**Complexity; simplicity; tradeoff; YAGNI; over-engineering; appropriateness; problem fit; optimization; pragmatism.**Start with simple patterns; add complexity only when needed; avoid over-engineering for simple problems.|
|**[[Testing Patterns]]**|Describe strategies for testing pattern-based workflows.**Testing; unit testing; integration testing; test coverage; verification; correctness; validation; quality assurance; reliability.**Test patterns: unit test nodes, integration test patterns, verify routing logic; ensure pattern correctness.**
|**[[Pattern Documentation]]**|Explain documenting patterns and design decisions.**Documentation; comments; design rationale; clarity; communication; knowledge transfer; team understanding; explanation.**Document why you chose a pattern, how it works, edge cases; helps team understand and maintain code.|
|**[[Real-World Pattern Usage]]**|Show where patterns appear in production systems.**Production; real systems; use cases; practical application; relevance; applicability; practical value; pattern adoption.**Most production systems use established patterns: agents with tools, retry logic, conditional branching; learn from examples.|
|**[[Pattern Evolution and Customization]]**|Describe adapting patterns to specific needs.**Customization; adaptation; modification; flexibility; problem-specific; variation; personalization; tailoring; pattern extension.**Patterns are templates; customize them for your specific requirements; extend patterns for novel needs.|
|**[[Choosing the Right Pattern]]**|Explain how to select appropriate patterns for a problem.**Pattern selection; problem analysis; requirements; matching; decision; appropriateness; analysis; match; fit analysis.**Analyze your problem, consider pattern options, choose best fit; combine patterns when needed for complex solutions.**
|**[[Pattern Learning Path]]**|Describe how to learn patterns effectively.**Learning progression; simple to complex; foundation; skills; mastery; progression; curriculum; learning journey; growth path.**Learn patterns progressively: master simple patterns first, then combine into complex workflows; build skills systematically.|
|**[[Common Pattern Mistakes]]**|Show common pitfalls when implementing patterns.**Mistakes; misapplication; incorrect implementation; anti-patterns; common errors; pitfalls; awareness; avoidance.**Common mistakes: over-engineering simple problems, incorrect routing logic, inefficient state usage; learn to avoid.|
|**[[Pattern Performance Implications]]**|Describe performance characteristics of different patterns.**Performance; efficiency; scalability; throughput; latency; optimization; trade-offs; measurement; awareness.**Different patterns have different performance; understand implications; optimize hot paths; measure before optimizing.|
|**[[Pattern Migration and Refactoring]]**|Explain refactoring to patterns when needed.**Refactoring; improvement; technical debt; pattern adoption; migration; gradual improvement; code quality; evolution.**Refactor to patterns incrementally; improves code quality; enables team consistency; systematic improvement.**
