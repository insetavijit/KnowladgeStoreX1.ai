Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.4.10 Edge Validation]]**, covering graph structure verification.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Edge Validation Overview**|Explain that graphs validate edges to ensure valid structure.**Graph validation; edge checking; structural validation; compilation validation; error detection; safety; correctness assurance.**Graph compilation validates edges to ensure all referenced nodes exist and graph structure is valid.|
|**[[Node Existence Checking]]**|Describe validating that edge targets exist as registered nodes.**Node reference validation; referenced node checking; missing nodes; error detection; registration validation; consistency checking.**During compilation, the graph verifies that all nodes referenced in edges have been registered with add_node().|
|**[[Dangling Edge Detection]]**|Explain identifying edges referencing non-existent nodes.**Missing node errors; dangling edges; broken edges; error reporting; early detection; validation errors; error messages.**If an edge references a node that doesn't exist, compilation fails with a clear error message.|
|**[[Node Registration Before Edges]]**|Show that nodes must be added before edges can reference them.**Order dependency; node-first; registration order; dependency; logical sequence; forward references; timing.**Nodes must be registered before edges reference them; register all nodes before defining edges.|
|**[[Cycle Detection]]**|Explain detecting cycles in the graph structure.**Cycle checking; circular paths; DAG validation; acyclic verification; cycle prevention; acyclic requirement; structural property.**The graph checks for cycles; non-loop workflows should be acyclic DAGs for guaranteed termination.|
|**[[Unreachable Node Detection]]**|Describe finding nodes that can't be reached from START.**Reachability analysis; unreachable nodes; orphaned nodes; path analysis; coverage checking; completeness verification.**Validation can identify nodes unreachable from START, indicating design errors or incomplete structure.|
|**[[Nodes Unreachable from END]]**|Explain finding nodes that don't have paths to END.**Termination path checking; dead ends; incomplete paths; coverage; termination guarantee; path analysis; completeness.**Validation identifies nodes without paths to END, indicating incomplete graphs or design issues.|
|**[[Graph Connectivity Validation]]**|Show that the graph structure is connected properly.**Connectivity checking; graph connectivity; component analysis; fragmentation; isolation; structure integrity; complete graph.**Valid graphs should be connected: all nodes on paths from START to END; no isolated components.|
|**[[Edge Type Consistency]]**|Describe ensuring edge types are consistent (normal vs conditional).**Edge type validation; consistency checking; normal edges; conditional edges; type correctness; semantic correctness.**Validate edge types: conditional edges need routing functions; normal edges should point to valid nodes.|
|**[[START Edge Validation]]**|Explain validating edges from the START node.**START edge checking; initial edges; entry validation; first nodes; routing from START; valid targets.**Edges from START should point to valid nodes; START is implicit and always exists.|
|**[[END Edge Validation]]**|Describe validating edges to the END node.**END edge checking; terminal edges; valid sources; termination validation; end routing; reachability.**Edges to END are valid from any node; validation ensures END is reachable from START.**
|**[[Conditional Edge Validation]]**|Show validating conditional edge routing functions.**Routing function validation; signature checking; return type checking; function validation; correctness; type safety.**Conditional edges require routing functions; validation checks function signatures and return types.|
|**[[Routing Function Return Values]]**|Explain validating that routing functions return valid node names.**Return value validation; node name checking; string return; valid routes; mapping validation; semantic correctness.**Routing functions must return registered node names; validation can check that returned names are valid.|
|**[[Path Completeness Analysis]]**|Describe checking that all START-to-END paths are complete.**Path coverage; path analysis; all paths to END; completeness checking; coverage analysis; reliability assurance.**Analysis can verify that all possible execution paths eventually reach END for deterministic termination.|
|**[[Validation Error Messages]]**|Show that validation errors are clear and helpful.**Error reporting; error messages; clarity; actionable errors; debugging aid; error descriptions; problem identification.**Validation errors should clearly identify the problem (missing node, dangling edge, cycle, etc.).|
|**[[Custom Validation Hooks]]**|Explain additional validation beyond automatic checks.**Custom validation; user-defined checks; semantic validation; business rule validation; extensibility; custom constraints; validation extension.**Some frameworks allow custom validation to check semantic properties beyond structural correctness.|

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.4.11 Complex Control Flow]]** or **[[1.1.4.12 Control Flow Best Practices & Pitfalls]]** to continue this validation track.
