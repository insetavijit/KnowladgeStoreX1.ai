Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.3.1 Agent Architecture Patterns]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.3.1.1 Agent Architecture Patterns Overview]]**|Designing agent systems|single agent, multi-agent, architecture patterns, system design|Agent architecture patterns define how agents are organized and interact in LangGraph systems.|
|**[[1.3.1.2 Single vs Multi-Agent]]**|Choosing agent count|single agent, multiple agents, when to use each, decision criteria|Single agents handle simple tasks; multi-agent systems enable specialization and parallel processing.|
|**[[1.3.1.3 Supervisor Pattern]]**|Centralized coordination|supervisor agent, delegation, task routing, central control|Supervisor pattern uses a central agent to coordinate and delegate tasks to specialized worker agents.|
|**[[1.3.1.4 Peer-to-Peer Pattern]]**|Decentralized coordination|peer agents, direct communication, equal agents, distributed control|Peer-to-peer patterns enable agents to communicate directly without central coordination.|
|**[[1.3.1.5 Hierarchical Pattern]]**|Layered architectures|hierarchical structure, parent-child agents, multi-level delegation, layered control|Hierarchical patterns organize agents in layers with parent agents coordinating child agents.|
|**[[1.3.1.6 Network Topology]]**|Agent connections|topology design, connection patterns, communication structure, network layout|Network topology defines how agents connect and communicate in multi-agent systems.|
|**[[1.3.1.7 Communication Patterns]]**|Inter-agent messaging|message passing, broadcast, point-to-point, publish-subscribe, communication protocols|Communication patterns determine how agents exchange information and coordinate actions.|
|**[[1.3.1.8 Coordination Strategies]]**|Agent coordination|coordination mechanisms, synchronization, conflict resolution, consensus building|Coordination strategies manage how multiple agents work together toward common goals.|
|**[[1.3.1.9 Pattern Selection]]**|Choosing architectures|pattern selection, use case matching, trade-offs, architecture decisions|Select patterns based on task complexity, coordination needs, and system requirements.|
|**[[1.3.1.10 Hybrid Patterns]]**|Combining patterns|hybrid architectures, pattern composition, mixed topologies, flexible designs|Hybrid patterns combine multiple architectures for complex multi-agent systems.|
|**[[1.3.1.11 Common Architectures]]**|Standard designs|common patterns, proven architectures, reference designs, standard topologies|Common architectures include supervisor-worker, peer networks, and hierarchical teams.|
|**[[1.3.1.12 Architecture Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready design|clear roles, minimize coupling, scalability, maintainability|Design clear agent roles, minimize dependencies, ensure scalability, and maintain clean architecture.|
