# 1.1.3 Instruction Design

| **Section** | **Focus** | **Key Utilities / Concepts** | **One-Line Recall** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[1.1.3.1 Clarity vs Ambiguity]]** | Input precision | Direct language, avoiding jargon, clear verbs, specific nouns | Highly clear instructions minimize the "search space" for the LLM, reducing hallucinations. |
| **[[1.1.3.2 Specificity & Constraints]]** | Output control | Detail density, explicit limits, length requirements, style guides | Adding specific details and constraints forces the model to honor precise requirements. |
| **[[1.1.3.3 Imperative vs Declarative Style]]** | Command tone | Action-oriented verbs, "Write", "Analyze", vs "Could you write" | Using imperative language (commands) provides stronger instruction following than passive descriptions. |
| **[[1.1.3.4 Task Framing & Scoping]]** | Conceptual bounds | Narrative framing, task boundaries, domain definition | How a task is framed (e.g., "Think like a historian") significantly changes the model's approach. |
| **[[1.1.3.5 Intent Disambiguation]]** | Error prevention | Conflict resolution, clarifying intent, removing assumptions | Proactively clearing up potential misunderstandings prevents the model from choosing the wrong path. |
| **[[1.1.3.6 Instruction Length & Concentration]]** | Cognitive load | Dense vs sparse instructions, instruction overload, focus points | Too many complex instructions at once can lead to the model "forgetting" or ignoring some details. |
| **[[1.1.3.7 Explicit vs Implicit Guidance]]** | Model inference | Stated rules vs suggested styles, inference reliance | Explicitly stating rules is always more reliable than relying on the model to "guess" your intent. |
| **[[1.1.3.8 Step-by-Step Decomposition]]** | Process design | Sequential logic, logical flow, sub-task ordering | Breaking a complex instruction into ordered steps improves the success rate of complex logical tasks. |
| **[[1.1.3.9 Vocabulary & Tone Control]]** | Linguistic style | Technical vs simple, formal vs casual, domain-specific terms | Controlling the instruction's vocabulary influences the linguistic output of the model. |
| **[[1.1.3.10 Instruction Weighting & Emphasis]]** | Attention management | Bold text, repetition, priority markers, "CRITICAL" tags | Using emphasis or repetition ensures the model prioritizes the most important parts of the prompt. |

This table represents a **complete guide to Instruction Design**, designed to transform vague requests into professional, production-grade LLM instructions.
