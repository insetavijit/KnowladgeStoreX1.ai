Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.7.9 Migration Considerations]]**, covering switching frameworks.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Migration Overview**|Explain challenges and strategies for switching frameworks.**Migration; switching frameworks; framework transition; changing tools; cost; risk; planning; strategy; challenges; migration approach; transition planning.**Migrating frameworks is significant undertaking; requires planning, risk assessment, phased approach; understand costs before committing to migration.|
|**[[Migration Decision Criteria]]**|Describe when migration justified.**Decision criteria; when to migrate; cost-benefit analysis; benefit assessment; cost assessment; necessity evaluation; justified migration; decision factors.**Migrate only if benefits exceed costs; assess: capability gap (current framework insufficient?), TCO comparison, risk assessment; justified migration analysis.|
|**[[Code Conversion Strategy]]**|Show translating code to new framework.**Code conversion; translation; rewriting; mapping; automated vs manual; conversion approach; effort estimation; translation strategy; conversion challenge.**Assess code conversion: automated tools for some parts? (LCEL to LangGraph), manual refactoring needed? estimate effort, plan approach; conversion strategy.|
|**[[Architecture Adaptation]]**|Explain redesigning architecture for new framework.**Architecture; redesign; pattern adaptation; topology redesign; leveraging new capabilities; taking advantage; architectural rethink; new approach; architecture reimagining.**New framework enables different architecture: LCEL chains (linear) to LangGraph (loops, routing); redesign to leverage new capabilities; architecture rethinking; opportunity.|
|**[[Pattern Mapping]]**|Describe translating patterns between frameworks.**Pattern mapping; pattern equivalents; finding equivalents; similar patterns; different names; concept mapping; translation; pattern translation; equivalence discovery.**Map patterns: identify equivalent patterns in new framework, translate code, adapt approach; pattern equivalence understanding; translation mapping; conceptual bridging.|
|**[[Incremental vs Big-Bang Migration]]**|Show gradual vs immediate migration approaches.**Incremental; gradual; phases; parallel; big-bang; immediate; risk; effort; approach; strategy trade-off; risk management approach; phased vs immediate; transition strategy.**Incremental migration (gradual, parallel operation) lower risk, longer timeline; big-bang migration (immediate) faster, higher risk; choose based on risk tolerance; phased approach safer.|
|**[[Parallel Operation During Migration]]**|Explain running both frameworks simultaneously.**Parallel operation; coexistence; both frameworks running; router; traffic splitting; gradual cutover; dual operation; transition technique; coexistence strategy; safety pattern.**Run both frameworks in parallel during migration: router directs traffic, new framework tested in production safely, gradual cutover; low-risk transition pattern.|
|**[[Testing During Migration]]**|Describe comprehensive testing strategy.**Testing; coverage; validation; behavior testing; regression testing; compatibility testing; migration testing; testing strategy; thorough verification; test discipline.**Test during migration: unit test new code, integration test with existing systems, regression test for behavior preservation, smoke tests on production cutover; thorough testing critical.|
|**[[Team Training and Ramp-up]]**|Show team learning new framework.**Team training; learning; ramp-up; knowledge transfer; skill development; training plan; learning curve; team preparation; capability building; skill acquisition.**Plan team training: allocate time for learning, hands-on practice, POCs, documentation; ramp-up time for proficiency; team readiness critical for successful migration.|
|**[[Risk Assessment and Mitigation]]**|Explain identifying and mitigating risks.**Risk identification; risk mitigation; contingency plans; rollback plans; risk management; what could go wrong; failure modes; mitigation strategy; safeguards; disaster prevention.**Identify risks (compatibility, performance, team capability gaps) and mitigation: fallback plans, rollback capability, gradual exposure, monitoring; risk management discipline.|
|**[[Data Migration and Compatibility]]**|Describe migrating persistent state and data.**Data migration; state migration; compatibility; schema mapping; data transformation; persistence layer; data preservation; data integrity; migration challenge; data translation.**Migrate state: map old schema to new, transform data, test compatibility, maintain integrity throughout; data migration careful planning; integrity assurance critical.|
|**[[Performance Verification**|Show validating performance after migration.**Performance testing; benchmarking; comparison; regression; performance goals; SLA compliance; validation; performance verification; meeting targets; performance assurance.**After migration verify performance: benchmark against goals, check SLA compliance, identify regressions, optimize if needed; performance validation critical for user satisfaction.|
|**[[Documentation and Knowledge Transfer]]**|Explain capturing lessons and knowledge.**Documentation; knowledge transfer; lessons learned; documentation updates; knowledge base; team understanding; future reference; knowledge preservation; documentation maintenance.**Document during migration: update architecture docs, capture lessons, document new patterns, team knowledge base; documentation maintains team knowledge; future reference.|
|**[[Vendor Lock-in and Long-term Planning]]**|Show planning for future flexibility.**Lock-in risk; flexibility; abstraction; independence; future options; contingency; long-term planning; framework independence; flexibility planning; future-proofing; contingency planning.**Plan for future flexibility: use abstraction layers, avoid framework-specific code, maintain options; reduces future lock-in risk; long-term strategic thinking; risk management.|
|**[[Cost Analysis of Migration]]**|Explain calculating true migration cost.**Cost; learning cost; development cost; testing cost; downtime cost; opportunity cost; total cost; cost-benefit; ROI; financial impact; budget planning; economic analysis.**Calculate migration cost: learning time (salary), dev time (salary), testing time, any downtime (lost business); compare to benefits; cost-benefit decision making; financial discipline.|
|**[[Rollback Plans]]**|Describe preparing for migration failure.**Rollback; failure recovery; quick reversion; fallback plan; contingency; abort criteria; quick recovery; disaster recovery; recovery capability; safety measure; risk mitigation.**Prepare rollback: can you quickly revert if migration fails? maintain old system ready, clear abort criteria, quick switchback capability; safety measure; risk reduction.|
|**[[Post-Migration Optimization]]**|Show optimizing after migration completes.**Optimization; post-migration; leveraging capabilities; fine-tuning; improvement; taking advantage; optimization opportunity; performance tuning; capability exploitation; refinement phase.**After migration completes: optimize to leverage new framework capabilities, fine-tune for performance, refactor to best practices; optimization phase; post-migration refinement.|
