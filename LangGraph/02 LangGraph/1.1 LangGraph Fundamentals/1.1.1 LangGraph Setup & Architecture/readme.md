**Knowledge Base Expansion Task**

I have a directory structure with:
- A ROOT/INDEX FILE listing all topics in a table format
- One EXAMPLE TOPIC FILE showing the desired structure and style
- Multiple remaining topics without detailed documents

Please:

1. **ANALYZE STRUCTURE**
   - Read the root file and extract the complete topics table
   - Read the example topic file to understand the format template
   - Identify: What are the column headers? How many subtopic rows? What's the style/voice?

2. **EXTRACT PATTERN**
   - How is the example organized internally?
   - What makes it "complete" vs a simple outline?
   - What's the progression of topics (foundational → advanced)?
   
3. **CREATE FOR EACH REMAINING TOPIC**
   - File name: Follow the same naming convention as examples
   - Structure: Replicate the example's table format exactly
   - Content: Generate 15-20 subtopic rows covering:
     * Specific aspect of the topic
     * Interview/learning goal (action-oriented)
     * Key concepts and technical details to study
     * Memorable one-line summary
   - Coherence: Each row should build logically, referencing the root file's key concepts

4. **VALIDATE**
   - Confirm all files created with proper naming
   - Verify structural consistency across all documents
   - Ensure technical and thematic alignment with root file

Expected Result: A complete knowledge base where every topic has equivalent depth and structure.
