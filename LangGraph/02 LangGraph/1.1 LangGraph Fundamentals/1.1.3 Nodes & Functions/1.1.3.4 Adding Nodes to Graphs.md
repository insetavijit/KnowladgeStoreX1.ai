Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.3.4 Adding Nodes to Graphs]]**, covering node registration and binding.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Adding Nodes to Graphs Overview**|Explain how to register node functions with a StateGraph.**add_node() method; node naming; function binding; graph structure; registration pattern; workflow building.**Nodes are added to a graph using graph.add_node(name, function) before edges are defined.|
|**[[add_node() Method]]**|Describe the syntax and usage of add_node().**graph.add_node("name", function); parameters; return value; registration; binding; method chaining; simplicity.**Call graph.add_node(node_name: str, node_function: Callable) to register a node with the graph.|
|**[[Node Naming**|Explain choosing unique, descriptive names for nodes.**Unique identifiers; descriptive names; semantic naming; conventions; clarity; reference value; edge declarations depend on names.**Node names must be unique within a graph; use descriptive names that indicate the node's purpose.|
|**[[Node Function Binding]]**|Describe binding a node function to its graph registration.**Reference binding; function reference; callable binding; execution context; identity; scope; late binding; invocation.**The add_node() call binds a function reference to a name; the graph later invokes the function.|
|**[[Multiple Nodes with Same Function**|Show registering the same function with different names if needed.**Reusable functions; multiple registrations; same logic, different identities; edge routing; flexibility; distinctness in graph.**The same function can be registered multiple times with different names for distinct graph nodes.|
|**[[Node Registration Order]]**|Explain whether node registration order matters.**Order independence; forward references; no ordering constraints; edge definition timing; optional; convenience; flexibility.**Nodes can be registered in any order; the graph is defined by edges, not registration order.|
|**[[Building Graphs Step-by-Step]]**|Show constructing a graph by adding nodes and edges incrementally.**Sequential building; incremental construction; clarity; testing; step-by-step; debugging; modular graph building.**Graphs are built incrementally: create graph, add nodes, add edges, compile.|
|**[[Node Reference in Edges]]**|Explain how node names are used in add_edge() calls.**Edge references; node identification; string names; edge source/target; naming importance; consistency; clarity.**When defining edges, reference nodes by the names given in add_node().|
|**[[Naming Conventions**|Describe best practices for node naming.**Descriptive names; verb-based; snake_case; clarity; consistency; semantics; intent communication; team standards.**Use clear, descriptive, snake_case names (e.g., call_llm, check_condition, process_tool_result).|
|**[[Node Registration with Decorators]]**|Show alternative syntax using decorators if available.**Decorator patterns; syntactic sugar; alternative registration; convenience; expressiveness; less common; framework features.**Some frameworks support @graph.node decorators; standard API uses explicit add_node() calls.|
|**[[Inline Lambda Registration]]**|Describe registering inline lambda functions vs named functions.**Lambda registration; single-use functions; inline logic; readability trade-offs; testing difficulty; simplicity vs maintainability.**Prefer named functions; use lambdas only for trivial single-line nodes for clarity.|
|**[[Registering Async Nodes**|Show adding asynchronous node functions to graphs.**async def registration; async functions with add_node(); execution model; concurrency; parameter handling; async/await usage.**Register async functions with add_node() the same way; the graph handles async execution.|
|**[[Managing Node References]]**|Explain keeping track of node names for edge definitions.**Node name consistency; reference documentation; naming registry; variable names; constants; error prevention; centralization.**Store node names as constants or in a registry to prevent typos in edge definitions.|
|**[[Node Organization & Structure**|Describe organizing many nodes in complex graphs.**Module organization; helper functions; classes; factory methods; generators; clear structure; maintainability; navigation.**Organize node functions in modules or classes for clarity in graphs with many nodes.|
|**[[Validation After Node Addition]]**|Show verifying nodes are properly registered before compilation.**Assertions; node list inspection; error checking; early detection; validation layer; confidence; debugging.**Optionally validate that expected nodes are registered before moving to edge definition phase.|
|**[[Graph Introspection]]**|Explain inspecting the graph's nodes for debugging and documentation.**graph.nodes; node list; introspection; discovery; runtime inspection; documentation generation; debugging aid.**Access graph.nodes or similar APIs to inspect registered nodes during development and debugging.|

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.3.5 Synchronous vs Async Nodes]]** or **[[1.1.3.6 Node Input/Output]]** to continue this registration track.
