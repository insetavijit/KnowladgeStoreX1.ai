Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.7.7 Framework Selection Criteria]]**, covering decision framework for choosing tools.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Framework Selection Overview**|Explain systematic approach to choosing frameworks.**Selection process; methodology; evaluation; decision-making; criteria; structured approach; systematic evaluation; decision framework.**Use structured criteria to evaluate frameworks; avoid arbitrary choices; match framework to needs; informed decision-making process.|
|**[[Requirement Analysis]]**|Describe identifying your actual requirements.**Requirements; needs analysis; what do you need; problem definition; constraints; scope; feature needs; capability requirements; need identification.**Start by analyzing requirements: what must it do? Complex routing? State needed? Looping? Human oversight? Document all requirements explicitly.|
|**[[Use Case Complexity]]**|Show assessing problem complexity level.**Complexity; simple vs complex; workflow complexity; feature needs; sophistication; scope; problem scale; complexity level; assessment.**Assess complexity: simple sequential? (LangChain), complex with routing/loops? (LangGraph), role-based agents? (CrewAI); match framework to complexity.|
|**[[Statefulness Requirement]]**|Explain determining if state needed.**State needs; stateless sufficient; stateful required; memory needs; context preservation; persistence; state requirement assessment.**Assess state needs: stateless (simple chains work fine), stateful (need agent memory, LangGraph); determines framework category fundamentally.|
|**[[Looping and Recursion Needs]]**|Describe when loops required for solution.**Looping needs; iterative needs; cycles; repeated execution; algorithm requirements; agent loops; looping necessity; requirement analysis.**Assess looping: iterative refinement? agent reasoning loops? (LangGraph needed), simple forward-only? (chains sufficient); determines topology capability needed.|
|**[[Customization and Control Needs]]**|Show analyzing required customization level.**Customization; control; flexibility; standard patterns sufficient; or custom logic; modification needs; extensibility; control level needed.**Assess control needs: off-the-shelf behavior? (simpler frameworks), custom behavior required? (flexible frameworks like LangGraph); control depth needed.|
|**[[Team Skills and Experience]]**|Explain assessing team expertise factor.**Team skills; expertise; background; Python proficiency; LLM experience; framework experience; learning capacity; skill matching; capability match.**Assess team: Python developers prefer LangGraph, LLM experts ready for complex frameworks, beginners benefit from simpler frameworks; skill matching important.|
|**[[Ecosystem and Integration Needs]]**|Describe evaluating integration requirements.**Integrations; ecosystem; tools; plugins; needed services; existing systems; compatibility; integration breadth; ecosystem importance; integration dependency.**Assess integrations: what services needed? (LangChain has richest ecosystem), existing systems to integrate? (assess compatibility), integration critical? (favor rich ecosystems).|
|**[[Performance Requirements]]**|Show defining performance needs.**Performance; latency targets; throughput targets; scalability; speed requirements; performance constraints; metrics; performance criteria; performance targets; performance importance.**Define performance targets: latency limit? throughput target? scalability need? assess frameworks against targets; overhead tolerance; performance criticality.|
|**[[Production Readiness]]**|Explain assessing production-readiness needs.**Production; stability; reliability; support; monitoring; logging; framework maturity; production quality; operational support; production requirements; maturity assessment.**Assess production needs: backward compatibility? support availability? monitoring tools? logging? error handling? production requirements; maturity evaluation.|
|**[[Learning Curve and Onboarding Time]]**|Describe assessing learning investment.**Learning curve; training time; onboarding; documentation; examples; community; support; learning resource availability; time to productivity; learning investment.**Assess learning time: team ramp-up time acceptable? good docs/examples available? community support? learning investment vs benefit; trade-off analysis.|
|**[[Long-Term Viability]]**|Show evaluating framework sustainability.**Viability; roadmap; active development; community health; backing; sustainability; longevity; future-proof; stability; continuity; future investment risk.**Assess viability: active development? healthy community? good roadmap? company backing? longevity indicators; framework abandonment risk; sustainability assessment.|
|**[[Cost of Ownership]]**|Explain calculating total cost factor.**TCO; learning cost; development cost; maintenance cost; licensing; switching cost; long-term cost; economic analysis; cost comparison; financial impact.**Calculate TCO: learning time cost, development time cost, maintenance cost, operation cost, switching cost if wrong; total investment consideration.|
|**[[Prototyping and Evaluation]]**|Describe testing frameworks before full commitment.**Prototyping; proof-of-concept; proof of concept; testing; trial; evaluation; hands-on; practical testing; pilot; learning by doing.**Don't rely only on reading; prototype with candidates: build small POC, experience framework firsthand; practical evaluation before commitment.|
|**[[Risk Assessment]]**|Show evaluating risks of each choice.**Risk; risk factors; risk mitigation; compatibility risk; obsolescence risk; vendor risk; community risk; lock-in risk; what could go wrong; risk evaluation; contingency.**Assess risks: technology risk (will it continue?), compatibility risk (integrations), lock-in risk (switching cost), community risk (support availability); mitigation strategies.|
|**[[Decision Matrix Template]]**|Explain structured evaluation approach.**Decision matrix; scoring; weighted criteria; evaluation tool; systematic evaluation; scoring method; structured choice; quantitative evaluation.**Use decision matrix: list criteria, weight importance, score frameworks, sum scores; quantitative approach reduces bias; structured decision making.|

Next, we'll cover **[[1.1.7.8 Integration Possibilities]]** for combining frameworks.
