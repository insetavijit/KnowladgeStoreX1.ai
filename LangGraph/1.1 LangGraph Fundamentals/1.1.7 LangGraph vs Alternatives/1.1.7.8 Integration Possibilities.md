|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Framework Integration Overview**|Explain combining frameworks for optimal results.**Framework integration; combining frameworks; complementary use; synergy; hybrid approach; leveraging strengths; best of both; integration strategy; composition.**Frameworks can complement each other; combining enables leveraging strengths of each; hybrid approaches often superior to single framework; composition strategy.|
|**[[LangGraph + LangChain Ecosystem]]**|Show the natural integration pattern.**Natural integration; built-in support; ecosystem integration; LCEL chains; runnable integration; composability; seamless integration; designed compatibility.**LangGraph and LangChain are complementary: use LCEL chains (simple) within LangGraph nodes (orchestration); natural integration, designed to work together.|
|**[[Using LCEL Chains in LangGraph Nodes]]**|Describe wrapping chains as node functions.**Chain wrapping; encapsulation; node functions; chain as node; integration pattern; composition; reuse; bridge; wrapper pattern; integration technique.**Wrap LCEL chains as LangGraph node functions: chain becomes node behavior, orchestrated by graph routing; clean composition; code reuse; modular design.|
|**[[Mixing Simple and Complex Logic]]**|Show combining simple nodes with complex orchestration.**Composition; hierarchy; simple nodes; complex orchestration; levels; layering; modularity; separation of concerns; clean architecture; architectural pattern.**Combine: simple LCEL chains for focused tasks, LangGraph for complex orchestration and routing; separation of concerns; clean modular architecture; layered design.|
|**[[CrewAI Crew as LangGraph Component]]**|Describe using specialized agents within larger orchestration.**Crew as component; subgraph; agent team; orchestration; larger system; composition; specialized agents; modularity; hierarchical agents; component wrapping.**Wrap CrewAI crew as LangGraph node or subgraph; delegating to specialized team, orchestrated by larger graph; hierarchical agent structure; role-based specialists within broader orchestration.|
|**[[LangChain Tools in LangGraph Agents]]**|Show using existing LangChain tools.**Tool integration; reuse; tool library; LangGraph tools; compatibility; tool compatibility; ecosystem reuse; existing resources; leveraging; compatibility layer.**Use LangChain tool definitions in LangGraph agents; tools defined once, used in both frameworks; maximize reuse; tool ecosystem leverage; resource efficiency.|
|**[[RAG Systems with Hybrid Frameworks]]**|Describe combining frameworks for RAG workflows.**RAG; hybrid RAG; retrieval; generation; component choice; specialized tools; LangChain retrieval; LangGraph orchestration; hybrid architecture.**Hybrid RAG: use LangChain retrievers (mature, rich ecosystem) with LangGraph orchestration (state, routing); optimize each component; leverage best tools; hybrid excellence.|
|**[[Agent Orchestration Patterns]]**|Show coordinating multiple agents or agent types.**Agent orchestration; multi-agent; agent coordination; agent composition; orchestration layer; delegation; hierarchical agents; coordination strategy.**Orchestrate multiple agents: LangGraph coordinates various agent types (specialized CrewAI crew, autonomous AutoGPT agents, etc.); master orchestration; unified control.|
|**[[Framework Abstraction Layer]]**|Describe abstracting framework differences.**Abstraction; wrapper; abstraction layer; interface; decoupling; flexibility; framework independence; swappability; abstraction pattern; isolation; dependency inversion.**Design abstraction layer: node interface hides framework details, swap implementations, reduce lock-in, enable testing; abstraction reduces coupling; flexibility pattern.|
|**[[Gradual Migration Strategy]]**|Show incrementally adopting new frameworks.**Migration; gradual adoption; incremental migration; coexistence; parallel systems; phase transition; migration path; gradual transition; staged adoption.**Migrate gradually: both frameworks coexist, new code uses new framework, old code unchanged; low-risk transition; gradual cutover; no big-bang migration.|
|**[[Interoperability Standards]]**|Explain using standards for framework independence.**Standards; interface standards; message standards; runnable interface; serialization; standards-based; common interface; interop; decoupling; contract-based interface.**Use runnable interface, standard message formats; frameworks with compatible standards integrate seamlessly; interface contracts enable flexibility; standard-based design.|
|**[[Testing with Multiple Frameworks]]**|Describe testing in hybrid systems.**Testing; integration testing; mock frameworks; testing strategy; behavior testing; contract testing; testing complexity; thorough testing; verification; multi-framework testing.**Test hybrid systems: test each framework in isolation, test integration between frameworks, use mocks, verify contract compliance; thorough testing; integration assurance.|
|**[[Monitoring and Observability Across Frameworks]]**|Show unified monitoring of multi-framework systems.**Monitoring; observability; distributed tracing; unified logging; observability platform; metrics aggregation; system visibility; cross-framework visibility; observability strategy.**Unified monitoring: centralized logging, distributed tracing across frameworks, aggregated metrics; visibility into entire hybrid system; observability critical for hybrid systems.|
|**[[Data Schema Consistency]]**|Explain maintaining consistent data across frameworks.**Schema; data model; consistency; compatibility; schema evolution; shared schema; data interchange; compatibility assurance; schema management; data compatibility.**Maintain consistent schemas across frameworks: define shared data models, version schemas, maintain compatibility, enable data flow between frameworks; schema discipline important.|
|**[[Performance Implications of Hybrid Approach]]**|Show performance considerations.**Performance; overhead; serialization; interop cost; efficiency; integration cost; measured; optimization; profiling; trade-off; performance impact; overhead analysis.**Hybrid systems add overhead: serialization, interop calls, multiple stacks; measure impact, optimize critical paths; verify overhead acceptable for flexibility gained; trade-off acceptance.|
|**[[Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity]]**|Describe resisting over-architecture temptation.**Over-architecture; unnecessary complexity; YAGNI; pragmatism; simplicity; when not to integrate; avoid premature; complexity judgment; pragmatic approach; pragmatism principle.**Avoid over-architecture: if single framework sufficient, use it; combine only when each framework adds clear value; pragmatism over purity; necessity judgment.|
