Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.7.12 Framework Selection Best Practices]]**, finalizing framework comparison coverage.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Framework Selection Best Practices Overview**|Explain key principles for informed framework choices.**Best practices; proven approaches; principles; guidance; quality decisions; effective selection; thoughtful approach; wisdom; decision quality; proven method; guidance principle.**Follow best practices to make informed framework selections; leverage experience; avoid common mistakes; increase success probability; proven approach.**
|**[[Start with Requirements, Not Hype]]**|Describe basing decision on needs, not trends.**Requirements first; need-driven; avoid hype; pragmatism; rational decision; genuine needs; business requirements; objective evaluation; grounded decision; avoiding fads; necessity-based.**Base decision on requirements not hype: what genuinely needed? avoid choosing cool new framework if existing solution sufficient; objective requirement-driven evaluation; pragmatism first.|
|**[[Understand Your Problem Domain]]**|Show deeply understanding problem before choosing.**Problem understanding; domain expertise; context; nuance; specific needs; problem-specific; context understanding; domain knowledge; deep understanding; nuanced approach; thorough analysis.**Deeply understand your problem domain: unique constraints? standard patterns? complexity level? client requirements? context understanding essential for fit; thorough analysis prerequisite.|
|**[[Evaluate Multiple Candidates]]**|Explain considering several options.**Multiple candidates; comparison; alternatives evaluation; not first impression; breadth of evaluation; competitive evaluation; options study; comparative analysis; comprehensive evaluation; avoid premature decision.**Evaluate multiple candidates: don't choose first framework that seems okay; compare options; assess strengths/weaknesses of each; comparative analysis; informed decision through options evaluation.|
|**[[Prototype Before Committing]]**|Describe testing with small POC.**Prototyping; proof-of-concept; hands-on evaluation; practical testing; real-world trial; learn by doing; experiential learning; practical assessment; test drive; pilot project; firsthand experience.**Prototype with candidates: build small POC to experience framework, assess learning curve, test integration, evaluate fit; practical evaluation essential; hands-on experience reveals issues.|
|**[[Consider Total Cost of Ownership]]**|Show calculating long-term costs.**TCO; total cost; learning cost; development cost; maintenance; operational cost; long-term analysis; economic evaluation; financial perspective; cost discipline; budget awareness.**Calculate TCO including: learning time (salary cost), development speed impact, maintenance burden, operational cost, switching cost risk; financial realism; long-term economic thinking.|
|**[[Get Team Input and Buy-in]]**|Explain involving team in decision.**Team input; consensus; team buy-in; stakeholder input; expert opinions; collective wisdom; team preferences; team capability; expertise input; collaborative decision; team engagement.**Involve team: their expertise valuable, their buy-in matters, they'll use the tool; collaborative decision-making increases acceptance and leverages team knowledge; consensus stronger than dictated choices.|
|**[[Assess Ecosystem and Support]]**|Show evaluating community and resources.**Ecosystem; community; documentation; examples; tutorials; support; libraries; integrations; ecosystem health; resource availability; support assessment; ecosystem richness; support availability; community strength.**Assess ecosystem: good documentation? helpful community? existing examples? available integrations? rich ecosystem reduces development burden; weak ecosystem increases support gaps; ecosystem matters.|
|**[[Review Roadmap and Sustainability]]**|Explain evaluating long-term viability.**Roadmap; active development; future direction; sustainability; backing; community health; stability; longevity; investment security; future-proofing; viability assessment; sustainability evaluation.**Review framework roadmap: active development? good direction? community health? backing? sustainable framework safer choice; avoid unmaintained tools or frameworks with unclear futures; sustainability important.|
|**[[Plan for Framework Lock-in Risk]]**|Describe designing to reduce dependency.**Lock-in; dependency; abstraction; independence; modularity; layer isolation; flexibility; future optionality; risk management; contingency planning; mitigation strategy; prevention approach.**Mitigate lock-in risk: use abstraction layers, avoid framework-specific patterns, keep code portable; reduces switching cost if needed later; prudent risk management; long-term thinking; contingency awareness.|
|**[[Document Selection Rationale]]**|Show explaining decision to team.**Documentation; decision record; rationale; explanation; team understanding; future reference; institutional knowledge; decision history; knowledge transfer; recording decision; rationale documentation; institutional memory.**Document your selection rationale: why this framework? alternatives considered? trade-offs? team reference; helps team understand, supports future decisions, aids onboarding; documentation discipline.**
|**[[Plan Ramp-up and Training]]**|Describe allocating time for team learning.**Training; ramp-up; learning plan; time allocation; skill building; knowledge development; team capability; proficiency timeline; learning schedule; training investment; capability building; learning readiness.**Plan training: allocate ramp-up time, provide resources, hands-on practice, build team capability; team readiness essential for success; learning investment prerequisite; capability assurance.|
|**[[Start Simple and Evolve]]**|Explain beginning with basic usage, advancing gradually.**Simple start; simple scope; MVPs; gradual complexity; evolutionary approach; incremental growth; learning curve; avoiding overwhelm; manageable scope; progressive complexity; learning progression; digestible approach.**Start simple: begin with basic usage, expand complexity as team learns; avoid over-architecting from start; evolutionary approach reduces overwhelm; learning progression natural; sustainable pace.**
|**[[Measure and Monitor Framework Fit]]**|Describe tracking whether framework working well.**Measurement; metrics; monitoring; assessment; ongoing evaluation; fit verification; success metrics; performance tracking; satisfaction; team feedback; retrospectives; ongoing assessment.**Measure during usage: Are requirements met? Team productive? Performance acceptable? Adapt if needed; ongoing assessment not one-time; flexibility to adjust if framework not fitting; continuous improvement mindset.|
|**[[Communicate and Keep Learning]]**|Explain staying informed and team communication.**Communication; learning; staying current; team knowledge sharing; documentation updates; skill improvement; evolution; continuous learning; information sharing; knowledge growth; team communication; learning culture.**Stay informed: learn from community, share knowledge with team, update documentation, improve expertise; communication culture important; learning organization; knowledge growth; team culture.*|
|**[[Balance Pragmatism and Idealism]]**|Show avoiding perfectionism while seeking quality.**Pragmatism; idealism; balance; good-enough; perfection trap; delivery; quality vs timeliness; practical excellence; realistic standards; acceptance criteria; pragmatic approach; balanced judgment; realistic goals.**Balance pragmatism and idealism: framework "good enough" often better than perfect framework that never comes; ship product with good framework over perfect system that never ships; pragmatic excellence; realistic outcomes.|
