Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.4.6 START and END Nodes]]**, covering graph boundaries.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**START and END Nodes Overview**|Explain the special START and END nodes that define graph boundaries.**Special nodes; graph entry; graph exit; constants; implicit semantics; framework semantics; essential concepts.**START marks graph entry; END marks completion and graph termination; both are special framework nodes.|
|**[[START Node Concept]]**|Define START as the implicit entry point to a graph.**START constant; entry point; first node trigger; initialization; graph kickoff; implicit node; starting point.|START is the special node where graph execution begins; edges from START determine first nodes.|
|**[[START Semantics]]**|Explain what START represents and when it executes.**Implicit entry; initial trigger; no incoming edges; execution beginning; initialization; kickoff; implicit invocation.**START is implicitly triggered when invoking a graph; no incoming edges point to START.|
|**[[Edges from START]]**|Show creating edges from START to begin execution.**add_edge(START, first_node); entry routing; first node selection; initialization routing; multiple entry paths.|Create edges from START to specify which node(s) execute first when the graph starts.|
|**[[END Node Concept]]**|Define END as the implicit exit point and termination marker.**END constant; exit point; termination; completion marker; final state; workflow conclusion; graph end.**END is the special node marking graph completion; when execution reaches END, the graph stops.|
|**[[END Semantics]]**|Explain what reaching END means for graph execution.**Termination; workflow completion; state return; execution conclusion; final state delivery; workflow closure; semantic meaning.**Reaching END terminates the graph and returns the final state to the caller.|
|**[[Edges to END]]**|Show creating edges to END for graph termination.**add_edge(source, END); terminal edges; completion routing; workflow conclusion; finalization paths; exit routes.|Create edges to END to specify when and how the workflow terminates.|
|**[[Multiple Entry Paths]]**|Describe graphs with multiple edges from START.**Parallel-like entry; multiple first nodes; fan-out; simultaneous start; multiple beginnings; complexity; concurrency model.**Graphs can have multiple edges from START, allowing multiple initial nodes to execute "in parallel".|
|**[[Multiple Exit Paths]]**|Explain having multiple edges to END.**Terminal branching; different completion paths; various endings; multiple exit routes; final destination; terminal edges.**Nodes can route to END via different paths; all are equivalent endpoints for termination.|
|**[[Conditional Entry via START]]**|Describe using conditional edges from START for variant entry points.**Conditional routing from START; initial routing; variant starts; start-time decisions; initialization branching.**Use conditional edges from START if different entry paths are needed based on initial state.|
|**[[Conditional Exit via END]]**|Explain conditionally routing to END based on state (early termination).**Conditional exit; early termination; completion detection; stop conditions; exit conditions; short-circuit; optimization.**Use conditional edges to route to END early when workflow completion is detected.|
|**[[START and END in Linear Graphs]]**|Show the simple linear flow: START -> Node1 -> Node2 -> END.**Linear model; sequential flow; simplicity; clarity; canonical form; common pattern; straightforward; basic structure.**Simplest graph: START -> Node1 -> Node2 -> ... -> END in linear sequence.**
|**[[START and END Node Naming]]**|Explain that START and END are special constants, not regular nodes.**Special constants; reserved names; framework constants; not regular nodes; implicit behavior; special semantics.**START and END are framework constants imported from langgraph; use these, not custom names.|
|**[[Implicit START Execution]]**|Describe that START doesn't need explicit definition or logic.**Implicit definition; no add_node() needed; framework-managed; automatic; no function; special handling; simplicity.|START is implicitly defined by the framework; no add_node() or function needed; edges trigger it.**
|**[[Implicit END Execution]]**|Explain that END is terminal; no outgoing edges possible.**Terminal node; no outgoing edges; implicit behavior; no function; end state; completion; finality; no further execution.**END is terminal; no outgoing edges or additional logic; reaching it stops graph execution.**
|**[[Graph Completion & State Return]]**|Describe what happens when END is reached.**State return; final state delivery; invocation completion; result delivery; workflow conclusion; caller notification; completion model.**When the graph reaches END, the final state is returned to the caller; execution stops.**

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.4.7 Graph Termination]]** or **[[1.1.4.8 Control Flow Patterns]]** to continue this boundaries track.
