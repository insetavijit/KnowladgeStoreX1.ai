Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.4.4 Edge Routing Functions]]**, covering decision logic implementation.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Edge Routing Functions Overview**|Explain that routing functions are the core of conditional edge logic.**Routing functions; decision functions; state inspection; return values; routing decisions; implementation; control logic.**Routing functions inspect state and return the next node name, implementing conditional edge logic.|
|**[[Routing Function Purpose]]**|Describe the role of routing functions in conditional edges.**Decision making; path selection; state inspection; logic implementation; routing determination; semantic meaning; clarity.**Routing functions decide which execution path to take based on current state values.|
|**[[Standard Routing Function Pattern]]**|Show the typical structure of routing functions.**def route(state: State) -> str: ... return node_name; pattern; clarity; consistency; simplicity; readability; standard form.**Pattern: receive state, inspect values, return the next node name as a string.|
|**[[State Parameter in Routing Functions]]**|Explain how routing functions receive and use state.**state parameter; type hint; field access; safe access; reading values; dict operations; typing safety.**Routing functions receive state as a typed parameter; access fields using dict notation or attribute access.|
|**[[Return Value Semantics]]**|Describe what the return value means.**Return string; node name; route identifier; control flow impact; semantics; clarity; next node selection; routing result.|The returned string determines which outgoing edge is followed, selecting the next node to execute.|
|**[[Simple Single-Field Checks]]**|Show routing based on simple state field values.**Single condition; field comparison; if/else; simple logic; clarity; directness; common case; foundation.**Simple routing: check one state field and return node name based on its value.|
|**[[Multi-Field Decision Logic]]**|Describe routing based on multiple state values.**Multiple conditions; combined logic; AND/OR logic; complex conditions; sophisticated decisions; richer routing; expressiveness.**Route based on multiple state fields: combine conditions with AND/OR to reach routing decisions.|
|**[[Comparison & Value-Based Routing]]**|Show routing decisions based on comparing values.**Greater than; less than; equality; comparisons; numeric logic; ordering; value-based decisions; threshold checking.**Route based on numeric comparisons: if count > 3, elif score > threshold, else default.|
|**[[List/Array Inspection in Routing]]**|Explain checking list contents to determine routing.**List length; empty checks; item presence; filtering; presence detection; collection logic; state analysis.**Check list fields: if len(list) == 0, route to end; if list exists, route to processor.|
|**[[Dict/Nested Object Routing]]**|Describe routing based on nested or dict fields.**Nested access; deep inspection; object properties; structured data; complex state; hierarchical inspection; logic depth.**Access nested dict fields safely to make routing decisions on complex nested state.**
|**[[Error Classification Routing]]**|Show routing based on error types or status codes.**Error detection; status inspection; error routing; recovery paths; error branching; error-driven routing; resilience.**Route based on error states: route to recovery nodes if errors detected, otherwise continue normally.|
|**[[Scoring & Ranking Routing]]**|Describe sophisticated routing based on computed scores.**Compute scores; ranking; best option selection; evaluation; optimization; sophisticated logic; decision making.**Compute scores for options; route to the node handling the highest-ranked or best option.|
|**[[Probabilistic Routing (Testing Patterns)]]**|Explain using randomization for A/B testing or exploration (in tests).**Random selection; A/B testing; exploration; testing patterns; experiment support; controlled randomness; testing aid.**Use randomized routing in tests to exercise different paths; avoid in production workflows.|
|**[[String Matching & Pattern Routing]]**|Describe routing based on string patterns or keywords.**String matching; keyword detection; regex; text analysis; classification; pattern detection; string-based decisions.**Route based on string content: if "error" in message, route to error handler, etc.|
|**[[Caching & Memoization in Routing]]**|Explain optimizing routing decisions with caching.**Caching results; memoization; performance; repeated decisions; optimization; overhead reduction; efficiency patterns.**Cache routing decisions if computing them is expensive; avoid redundant calculations.|
|**[[Documenting Routing Logic]]**|Show clearly documenting routing functions for maintainability.**Docstrings; parameter docs; routing explanation; branch documentation; clarity; maintainability; knowledge preservation.**Document routing functions: explain decision criteria, return values, and edge cases.|
|**[[Routing Function Testing Strategies]]**|Describe comprehensive testing of routing logic.**Unit tests; state fixtures; all paths; edge cases; error states; test coverage; correctness; reliability.**Write tests for each routing path; test edge cases and error states for robustness.|

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.4.5 Branch Conditions & Logic]]** or **[[1.1.4.6 START and END Nodes]]** to continue this routing logic track.
