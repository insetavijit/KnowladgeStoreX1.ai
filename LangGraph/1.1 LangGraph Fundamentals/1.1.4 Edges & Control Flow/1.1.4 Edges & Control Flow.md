|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.1.4.1 Edges & Control Flow Overview]]**|What edges control in graphs|graph connections, routing logic, flow direction, transitions|Edges define how control moves between nodes, determining workflow execution paths.|
|**[[1.1.4.2 Adding Normal Edges]]**|Simple node connections|add_edge method, source to target, linear flow, sequential execution|Normal edges create fixed connections between nodes for linear workflow progression.|
|**[[1.1.4.3 Conditional Edges]]**|Dynamic routing|add_conditional_edges, routing functions, branch conditions, decision logic|Conditional edges enable dynamic routing based on state values or conditions.|
|**[[1.1.4.4 Edge Routing Functions]]**|Conditional routing logic|routing functions, state inspection, return values, next node selection|Routing functions examine state and return the next node name for conditional edges.|
|**[[1.1.4.5 Branch Conditions & Logic]]**|Decision making|if-else logic, state checks, boolean conditions, complex routing|Branch conditions use state values to determine which path the graph follows next.|
