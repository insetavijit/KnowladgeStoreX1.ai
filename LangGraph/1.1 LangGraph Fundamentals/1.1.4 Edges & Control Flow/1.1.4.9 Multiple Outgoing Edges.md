Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.4.9 Multiple Outgoing Edges]]**, covering branching from single nodes.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Multiple Outgoing Edges Overview**|Explain how one node can have multiple outgoing edges for branching.**Node branching; divergence; multiple targets; routing options; fan-out; parallel paths; control flow splitting; complexity.**Nodes can have multiple outgoing edges, creating branches where different paths may execute next.|
|**[[Unconditional Multiple Edges]]**|Describe a node with multiple unconditional outgoing edges.**Parallel-like edges; fan-out; multiple targets; simultaneous execution; no conditions; multiple paths; concurrency model.**A node can have multiple unconditional edges; all targets execute (parallel-like) if reachable via edges.|
|**[[Conditional Multiple Edges]]**|Explain multiple edges where exactly one is followed.**Conditional branching; mutual exclusive paths; one chosen; routing decision; condition-driven; decision point; routing selection.**add_conditional_edges() creates multiple edges; routing function selects exactly one to follow.|
|**[[Fan-Out Pattern]]**|Describe one node branching to many independent downstream nodes.**Parallelism; concurrency; independent paths; fan-out; divergence; multiple simultaneous execution; efficiency; throughput.**Fan-out: one node followed by multiple independent nodes executing without waiting for each other.|
|**[[Branching with if/elif/else]]**|Show routing to one of many nodes based on conditions.**Multi-way branching; cascading conditions; multiple routes; conditional selection; routing logic; if/elif/else pattern.**Use conditional edges with if/elif/else logic to route to one of many possible next nodes.|
|**[[Default Path in Multi-Branch]]**|Explain providing a default route when no condition matches.**Default routing; catch-all path; fallback route; unexpected states; robustness; safety; default case; graceful handling.**Always provide a default route in multi-branch logic for unexpected states or uncovered cases.|
|**[[Converging Multiple Paths]]**|Show multiple outgoing paths from one node eventually converging.**Path convergence; rejoining; merge points; synchronization; multiple paths to same target; fan-in pattern; path combination.**Multiple branches can reconverge at a common downstream node for joining results.|
|**[[Parallel Execution via Multiple Edges]]**|Describe how multiple unconditional edges enable parallel-like execution.**Parallel model; concurrent execution; multiple nodes; simultaneous start; send() API; fan-out; concurrency pattern; throughput.**Use multiple unconditional edges to enable parallel execution of independent processing paths.|
|**[[Synchronizing Results from Multiple Paths]]**|Show combining results from multiple branches using reducers.**Result combination; reducer merging; state aggregation; fan-in; synchronization; result gathering; state merging; synchronization point.**Multiple branches route to common node; reducers merge their updates into unified state.|
|**[[Error Path from Node]]**|Describe routing to error handlers when nodes fail.**Error branching; error path; failure routing; exception handling; error recovery; error-specific route; error-driven routing.**Nodes can conditionally route to error handlers if they detect failures or errors in processing.|
|**[[Optional Alternative Paths]]**|Explain branching where some paths are optional or skipped.**Conditional branching; optional steps; skip logic; conditional execution; flow flexibility; alternative routes; optional branching.**Branch to optional processing nodes; use conditions to skip paths when they're not needed.|
|**[[Resource-Intensive Path Handling]]**|Show branching to different paths based on resource constraints.**Resource-aware routing; cost-based routing; performance-based; efficiency routing; optimization; cost management; routing based on constraints.**Route to simpler/faster path if resources are limited; use expensive path when available.|
|**[[Priority-Based Routing]]**|Describe routing to highest-priority or best option from many choices.**Scoring routing; priority selection; ranking; best option; ranking logic; optimization; preference-based routing; decision-making.**Compute scores for options; route to highest-priority or best-matching path based on evaluation.|
|**[[A/B Testing Paths]]**|Explain using branching for A/B testing different approaches (in testing contexts).**A/B testing; experiment routing; variant testing; comparison; testing pattern; controlled experiments; exploration.**Route to variant paths for A/B testing during development; avoid randomization in production.|
|**[[Documenting Complex Branching]]**|Show clearly documenting multi-branch logic for maintainability.**Documentation; comments; logic explanation; branch documentation; branch descriptions; clarity aids; maintainability.**Document multi-branch points: explain each branch's purpose, conditions, and expected outcomes.|
|**[[Testing All Branches]]**|Describe ensuring all branch paths are tested comprehensively.**Branch coverage; path testing; all branches; edge cases; test all routes; comprehensive testing; correctness; reliability.**Write tests covering all possible branches; test both expected conditions and edge cases.|

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.4.10 Edge Validation]]** or **[[1.1.4.11 Complex Control Flow]]** to continue this branching track.
