|**[[State Machine Implementation]]**|Describe using states and conditional edges to implement state machines.**State machines; phase transitions; state-driven routing; state progression; structured control; disciplined flow; architectural pattern.**Implement state machines: use state flags for phases; use conditional edges for state transitions.**
|**[[Retry with Exponential Backoff]]**|Show implementing retry loops with backoff strategies.**Retry patterns; backoff; exponential backoff; transient errors; attempt tracking; sophisticated resilience; error recovery patterns.**Implement retries with backoff: loop back to retry node; increase delay based on attempt count.|
|**[[Cascading Fallbacks]]**|Describe trying alternatives in sequence, falling back progressively.**Fallback chains; alternative attempts; graceful degradation; try options sequentially; recovery strategies; resilience pattern.**Try primary approach; if fails, fallback to alternative; if that fails, fallback to next, etc.|
|**[[Dynamic Path Selection]]**|Show routing based on computed scores or rankings.**Scoring logic; path selection; best option selection; optimization; ranking; evaluation; dynamic routing; decision making.**Compute scores for options; route to highest-scoring path; dynamically select best approach.**
|**[[Conditional Loop Exit]]**|Describe complex loop termination based on multiple conditions.**Loop guards; termination conditions; multi-factor exits; complex conditions; safety guards; iteration control; break conditions.**Exit loops based on multiple conditions: max iterations, success detection, error detection, timeout, etc.|
|**[[Error Recovery Routing]]**|Show routing through error-specific recovery paths.**Error detection; error classification; error-specific handlers; recovery paths; specialized handling; resilience; error-driven routing.**Route to specialized handlers based on error type; implement recovery paths for different failure modes.|
|**[[Resource-Aware Routing]]**|Explain routing based on available resources or constraints.**Resource checking; constraint-based routing; conditional paths; resource availability; efficiency routing; adaptive routing; smart routing.**Route differently based on available resources: memory, CPU, quota usage, or other constraints.|
|**[[Time-Based Routing]]**|Describe routing decisions based on elapsed time or deadlines.**Time tracking; deadline checking; time-based branching; urgency-based routing; timeout handling; deadline awareness; time-driven decisions.**Route based on execution time: if approaching deadline, skip expensive steps; use fast path instead.|
|**[[Context-Aware Branching]]**|Show routing that considers accumulated context and history.**History inspection; context building; informed routing; contextual decisions; accumulated knowledge; intelligent routing; awareness.**Route based on accumulated context: what was tried before, what succeeded, what failed, what's available.|
|**[[Probabilistic Branching (Testing)]]**|Explain using randomization in branching for testing or exploration.**Randomized routing; A/B testing; exploration; testing patterns; experiment design; controlled randomness; test-only patterns.**Use randomized branching in tests for A/B testing or exploring different paths; avoid in production.|
|**[[Graph Composition (Subgraph Routing)]]**|Describe breaking complex workflows into subgraphs or modular pieces.**Graph composition; modular graphs; subgraph routing; abstraction; complexity management; hierarchical control; modularity.**Break complex flows into modular subgraphs; route between them for manageability.|
|**[[Priority-Based Path Selection]]**|Show routing to high-priority paths when multiple options exist.**Priority routing; best option; preference-based; urgency-based; importance-weighted; decision criteria; sophisticated selection.**Route based on priority scores: high-priority path first, fallback to lower priority if needed.|
|**[[Regulatory/Constraint Routing]]**|Explain routing that respects business rules and compliance constraints.**Constraint validation; regulatory requirements; business rules; policy enforcement; compliance routing; rule-based routing; principled control flow.**Route respecting business rules: approval requirements, compliance rules, audit trails, policy enforcement.**
