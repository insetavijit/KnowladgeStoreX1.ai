Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.1.5 Compilation & Execution]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.1.5.1 Compilation & Execution Overview]]**|How graphs run|compiling graphs, executable graphs, runtime execution, graph lifecycle|Graphs must be compiled before execution to create runnable workflow instances.|
|**[[1.1.5.2 Compiling Graphs]]**|Creating executable graphs|compile method, CompiledGraph, graph validation, preparation|Compiling validates graph structure and prepares it for execution with state management.|
|**[[1.1.5.3 invoke() Method]]**|Synchronous execution|invoke(), blocking execution, single run, result return|invoke() executes the graph synchronously once and returns the final state.|
|**[[1.1.5.4 stream() Method]]**|Streaming execution|stream(), incremental results, event streaming, real-time updates|stream() executes the graph and yields state updates as nodes execute incrementally.|
|**[[1.1.5.5 Execution Modes]]**|Different run types|single run, streaming, batch, interactive|Execution modes include one-shot, streaming, batch processing, and interactive runs.|
|**[[1.1.5.6 Checkpointing in Execution]]**|State persistence during runs|checkpointers, state snapshots, resumable execution, recovery|Checkpointing saves state at execution points, enabling pause and resume capabilities.|
|**[[1.1.5.7 Graph Validation]]**|Ensuring graph correctness|validation checks, node existence, edge validity, structure verification|Compilation validates graph structure, nodes, edges, and state schema correctness.|
|**[[1.1.5.8 Debugging Compilation Errors]]**|Fixing graph issues|common errors, missing nodes, invalid edges, schema mismatches|Common issues include undefined nodes, invalid edges, and state schema mismatches.|
|**[[1.1.5.9 Execution Context]]**|Runtime environment|config dict, thread_id, checkpoint config, execution metadata|Execution context includes configuration, thread IDs, and checkpoint settings per run.|
|**[[1.1.5.10 Async Execution]]**|Asynchronous graph runs|ainvoke(), astream(), concurrent execution, async graphs|Async methods enable non-blocking execution and concurrent graph runs.|
|**[[1.1.5.11 Execution Performance]]**|Optimizing runtime|execution speed, node performance, state overhead, profiling|Performance depends on node efficiency, state size, and graph complexity.|
|**[[1.1.5.12 Execution Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready execution|error handling, timeout management, resource cleanup, monitoring|Handle errors, set timeouts, clean resources, and monitor execution in production.|
