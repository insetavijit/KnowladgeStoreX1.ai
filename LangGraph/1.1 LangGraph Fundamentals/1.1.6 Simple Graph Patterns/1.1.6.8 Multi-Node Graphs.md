Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.6.8 Multi-Node Graphs]]**, covering complex workflow coordination.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Multi-Node Graphs Overview**|Explain graphs with multiple coordinated nodes.**Multi-node; orchestration; coordination; complex workflows; multiple steps; choreography; complex patterns; sophisticated coordination.**Multi-node graphs coordinate multiple steps; each node handles focused responsibility; enables complex workflow orchestration.|
|**[[Node Coordination Patterns]]**|Show how multiple nodes work together.**Coordination; choreography; orchestration; data flow; sequencing; interaction; communication; synchronization; node interaction patterns.**Nodes coordinate through shared state: each node reads state, modifies it, returns it; state carries information between nodes.|
|**[[Graph Topology Design]]**|Describe designing effective graph structures.**Graph design; topology; structure; layout; node arrangement; edge pattern; efficient topology; good structure; design principles.**Design topology: plan node flow, minimize dependencies, avoid unnecessary connections; clear, logical structure.**
|**[[Separation of Concerns in Multi-Node]]**|Explain focused single-responsibility per node.**Responsibility; focus; modularity; separation; each node does one thing; narrow scope; clarity; maintainability; design principle.**Each node focuses on one concern: data validation, transformation, API call, etc.; improves clarity and reusability.|
|**[[Data Passing Through Multiple Nodes]]**|Show state flowing through node chain.**State flow; data propagation; state updates; progressive modification; state accumulation; state evolution; data journey.**State flows: node1 reads state, modifies, returns; node2 receives modified state, modifies further, returns; continues through chain.|
|**[[Node Dependencies]]**|Describe node prerequisites and ordering constraints.**Dependencies; prerequisites; ordering; requirements; constraints; sequential requirements; dependency analysis; constraint management.**Node B might depend on output from node A; ordering is determined by dependencies; graph edges enforce ordering.**
|**[[Parallel Execution in Multi-Node]]**|Show independent nodes executing concurrently.**Parallel execution; concurrent nodes; independence; parallelization; concurrency; simultaneity; efficiency; throughput improvement.**Independent nodes can execute in parallel; reduces total latency; improves throughput; enables efficient resource use.**
|**[[Synchronization Points]]**|Describe waiting for multiple paths to converge.**Synchronization; merge; join; convergence; waiting; dependencies; all-must-complete; joining paths; convergence point.**Synchronization nodes wait for all incoming paths to complete; merge results; continue with combined data.**
|**[[Conditional Routing Between Nodes]]**|Explain routing logic in multi-node graphs.**Conditional edges; routing; decision logic; dynamic routing; path selection; conditional flow; decision making; flexible routing.**Use conditional edges to implement sophisticated routing: different nodes for different conditions; enables flexible workflows.**
|**[[Node Reusability Across Graphs]]**|Show designing reusable node functions.**Reusability; modularity; composition; reuse; function design; testability; generality; shared components; component reuse.**Design nodes as reusable functions; use in multiple graphs; modular design improves reuse and maintainability.**
|**[[State Management in Complex Graphs]]**|Describe state schema for multi-node workflows.**State schema; field design; shared state; coordination state; message passing; schema design; state structure; complex schemas.**Design schema for all nodes: shared fields for coordination, node-specific fields for local data; clear structure.**
|**[[Error Propagation in Multi-Node]]**|Show how errors flow through multi-node graphs.**Error handling; error propagation; failure modes; error recovery; graceful failure; error routing; failure pattern; resilience.**Errors in one node affect downstream; handle at node level or use error routing; decide: fail fast or graceful recovery.|
|**[[Testing Multi-Node Graphs]]**|Describe comprehensive testing of complex graphs.**Testing strategy; unit testing; integration testing; node testing; graph testing; test coverage; thorough testing; comprehensive approach.**Test nodes independently, test graph integration, test routing, test state flow; verify correct coordination and results.**
|**[[Debugging Complex Graphs]]**|Show debugging strategies for multi-node workflows.**Debugging; tracing; logging; visualization; stepping; breakpoints; problem diagnosis; debugging tools; systematic debugging.**Debug: trace state flow through nodes, log state changes, visualize graph, step through execution; identify issues.**
|**[[Performance Optimization of Multi-Node Graphs]]**|Explain optimizing complex workflows.**Optimization; bottleneck identification; parallelization; caching; efficiency improvement; throughput; latency; performance analysis.**Optimize: identify critical path, parallelize independent nodes, optimize bottleneck nodes, reduce state size; measure improvements.|

Next, we'll cover **[[1.1.6.9 Sequential vs Parallel Patterns]]**.
