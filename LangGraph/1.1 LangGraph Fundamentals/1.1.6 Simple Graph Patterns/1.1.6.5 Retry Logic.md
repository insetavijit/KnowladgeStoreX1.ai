Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.6.5 Retry Logic]]**, covering error recovery and resilience patterns.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Retry Logic Overview**|Explain retrying failed operations for resilience.**Retry patterns; error recovery; resilience; fault tolerance; transient failures; recovery strategy; reliability; error handling.**Retry patterns re-execute failed operations; handle transient failures; improve reliability and robustness.|
|**[[Basic Retry Pattern]]**|Show simple retry on failure.**Retry logic; try-except-retry; error detection; re-execution; attempt tracking; basic pattern; simple recovery; simple retries.**Basic retry: wrap operation in try/except; on error, retry same operation; track attempt count.**
|**[[Retry with Max Attempts]]**|Describe limiting retries to prevent infinite loops.**Max attempts; attempt limit; bounded retries; safety; runaway prevention; stopping point; termination; retry limit.**Limit retries: track attempt count in state; check if attempts < max_attempts; give up if exceeded; prevent endless loops.|
|**[[Exponential Backoff]]**|Explain increasing delays between retries.**Backoff; exponential backoff; delay; sleep time; increasing delays; retry delay; spacing; delay strategy; gradual spacing.**Exponential backoff: 2^attempt * base_delay; delay grows with each retry; reduces server load; polite retry strategy.**
|**[[Linear Backoff]]**|Show simple linear delay increase between retries.**Linear backoff; arithmetic progression; constant increment; simple backoff; delay strategy; straightforward delay; simple approach.**Linear backoff: delay = attempt * base_delay; simpler than exponential; suitable for many scenarios.**
|**[[Jitter in Retry Delays]]**|Describe adding randomness to avoid thundering herd.**Jitter; randomness; thundering herd prevention; variance; spread out; timing variation; collision avoidance; distributed retries.**Add jitter: randomize delay to avoid all clients retrying at same time; prevents thundering herd; improves distribution.**
|**[[Retry With State Preservation]]**|Explain maintaining state across retry attempts.**State preservation; progress tracking; partial progress; state maintenance; context preservation; information retention; memory.**Preserve state across retries: store context, partial results; on retry, continue from where left off; avoid re-doing work.**
|**[[Conditional Retries]]**|Show retrying only for specific error types.**Selective retry; error type filtering; retry conditions; specific errors; transient errors; permanent errors; smart retry; discrimination.**Retry only on transient errors (timeouts, rate limits); don't retry permanent errors (auth failures, validation errors).**
|**[[Retry Circuit Breaker Pattern]]**|Describe failing fast after many consecutive failures.**Circuit breaker; fail fast; failure cascade; protection; rapid failure; giving up; preventing repeated attempts; protection mechanism.**After N consecutive failures, break circuit; fail immediately without retrying; prevents wasted retries after real failures.|
|**[[Logging Retry Attempts]]**|Show logging retries for observability.**Logging; observability; visibility; debugging; monitoring; tracking attempts; retry information; diagnostic information; visibility aid.**Log each retry attempt: error info, attempt number, delay, decision; aids debugging and monitoring.**
|**[[Retry in Distributed Systems]]**|Explain retry strategies for remote operations.**Distributed retries; network failures; timeout; transient failures; recovery; remote calls; distributed context; networked systems.**For network calls: retry on timeouts, connection errors; use backoff; idempotent operations essential for safe retries.**
|**[[Idempotency Requirement for Retries]]**|Describe why retried operations must be idempotent.**Idempotency; side-effects; safety; safe retries; duplicate prevention; state consistency; multiple executions; correctness guarantee.**Retried operations must be idempotent: safe to execute multiple times with same result; essential for correct retries.**
|**[[Testing Retry Logic]]**|Describe testing retry patterns comprehensively.**Test coverage; failure injection; retry verification; attempt counting; backoff checking; test strategy; thorough testing; correctness assurance.**Test: inject failures, verify retries happen, check attempt counts, verify backoff timing, confirm success after retry.**
|**[[Retry Composition in Larger Patterns]]**|Show using retry logic within larger workflows.**Composition; pattern combination; nesting; integration; hybrid patterns; larger workflows; sophisticated behavior; building blocks.**Use retry in larger patterns: wrap critical nodes with retry logic; add resilience to linear/branching/loop patterns.**
|**[[Metrics and Monitoring of Retries]]**|Explain tracking and monitoring retry behavior.**Metrics; retry rate; failure rate; recovery rate; monitoring; observability; metrics collection; success tracking; performance metrics.**Track: retry rates, success after retries, failure patterns; use metrics to improve reliability and find bottlenecks.**

Next, we'll cover **[[1.1.6.6 Basic Agent Patterns]]** for LLM-based reasoning and tool use.
