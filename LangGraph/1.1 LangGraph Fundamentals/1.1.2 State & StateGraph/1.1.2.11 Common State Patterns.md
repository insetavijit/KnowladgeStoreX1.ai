|**[[Complex Workflow State]]**|Show combining multiple patterns in complex, multi-phase workflows.**Layered patterns; phase tracking; state evolution; pattern composition; rich state; flexible design; advanced workflows.**Combine multiple patterns (messages, results, flags, config) for complex, multi-phase workflows.|
|**[[State Pattern Validation]]**|Explain ensuring state conforms to expected pattern structure.**schema validation; assertion checks; type checking; structure verification; safety; early detection; pattern conformance.|Validate that state conforms to expected patterns using assertions and type checks in nodes.|
|**[[Pattern Anti-Patterns**|Identify state patterns to avoid.**Oversized state; unclear structure; mixed concerns; brittle dependencies; weak typing; undocumented patterns; complexity bloat.**Avoid patterns with poor naming, unclear structure, or tight coupling between unrelated fields.|
