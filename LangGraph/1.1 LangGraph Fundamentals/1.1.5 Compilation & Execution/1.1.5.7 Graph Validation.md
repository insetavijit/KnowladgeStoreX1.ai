Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.5.7 Graph Validation]]**, covering structure verification.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Graph Validation Overview**|Explain validation as ensuring graph correctness before execution.**Validation; correctness checking; structure validation; error detection; compilation checks; safety assurance; reliability.**Graph compilation performs validation to ensure the graph is correct and ready for execution.|
|**[[Node Existence Validation]]**|Describe checking that all referenced nodes are registered.**Node registry check; missing nodes; undefined references; error detection; completeness; registration validation; reference checking.**Validation verifies all nodes referenced in edges were registered with add_node(); fails if missing.|
|**[[Edge Validity Checking]]**|Explain verifying edge source/target nodes exist.**Edge validation; source/target checking; node existence; reference validation; structural integrity; edge correctness; completeness.**Validation checks that all edge sources and targets are registered nodes; reports errors if invalid.|
|**[[State Schema Validation]]**|Show validating the state schema definition.**TypedDict validation; schema correctness; type checking; field validation; consistency; schema soundness; type integrity.**Validation verifies state schema: all fields properly typed, no conflicts, consistent definitions.|
|**[[Connectivity Validation]]**|Describe checking graph is properly connected.**Graph connectivity; connectivity analysis; isolated components; fragmentation; path analysis; reachability; structure integrity.**Validation checks graph connectivity: all nodes reachable from START, paths to END; no isolated components.|
|**[[START/END Node Validation]]**|Explain checking START and END nodes are properly configured.**START/END presence; edge configuration; entry/exit validity; graph boundaries; valid edges from/to special nodes; structure completeness.**Validation ensures edges from START and to END are properly defined; graph has valid entry/exit.|
|**[[Cycle Detection]]**|Describe detecting cycles in the graph structure.**Cycle checking; acyclic validation; loop detection; DAG verification; circular paths; infinite loop prevention; structural property checking.**Validation detects cycles; most workflows should be DAGs for guaranteed termination without cycles.|
|**[[Unreachable Node Detection]]**|Show identifying nodes unreachable from START.**Reachability analysis; unreachable detection; orphaned nodes; dead code; path analysis; coverage checking; completeness assurance.**Validation identifies nodes unreachable from START; indicates design errors or incomplete graphs.**
|**[[Nodes with No Path to END]]**|Explain detecting nodes that can't reach END.**Termination path checking; no-path-to-END detection; dead ends; incomplete paths; path analysis; termination guarantee.**Validation identifies nodes without paths to END; indicates incomplete graphs or missing edges.|
|**[[Type Checking in Validation]]**|Describe type safety validation for state and nodes.**Type validation; mypy integration; type correctness; schema types; type safety; static type checking; type errors; correctness assurance.**Validation can use mypy or runtime type checks to verify type correctness in nodes and state schema.|
|**[[Routing Function Validation]]**|Explain validating conditional edge routing functions.**Routing function checking; signature validation; return type checking; callable validation; semantic correctness; function validity.**Validation verifies routing functions exist, have correct signatures, return valid node names.|
|**[[Duplicate Node Names]]**|Show detecting if the same node name is used twice.**Duplicate detection; name uniqueness; node identity; registration conflicts; error detection; uniqueness requirement.**Validation ensures node names are unique; prevents accidental registration of duplicate names.|
|**[[Missing Required Fields]]**|Describe ensuring state schema has all required fields.**Required field checking; field completeness; schema completeness; mandatory fields; existence validation; required definition.**Validation verifies required state fields are defined; optional fields properly marked with Optional[].|
|**[[Edge Case Detection]]**|Show validation identifying edge cases and edge conditions.**Edge case identification; corner cases; special cases; unusual patterns; alerting; warning generation; detection; awareness.**Validation can warn about unusual patterns: unconnected nodes, unusually deep nesting, etc.|
|**[[Error Message Clarity]]**|Describe validation errors are clear and actionable.**Error messages; clarity; problem identification; diagnostic information; guidance; actionable errors; debugging aid; helpful reporting.**Validation error messages clearly identify the problem and location; provide guidance for fixing issues.|
|**[[Validation Extension Points]]**|Explain custom validation beyond built-in checks.**Custom validation; user-defined checks; semantic validation; business rules; extensibility; custom constraints; validation hooks.**Some frameworks allow custom validation for semantic checks beyond structural correctness.|

If you want, I can next create similar tables for **[[1.1.5.8 Debugging Compilation Errors]]** or **[[1.1.5.9 Execution Context]]** to continue this validation track.
