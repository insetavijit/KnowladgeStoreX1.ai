Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.5.10 Async Execution]]**, covering non-blocking asynchronous runs.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Async Execution Overview**|Explain asynchronous execution for non-blocking graph runs.**Async methods; non-blocking; concurrency; async/await; event loop; concurrent execution; asynchronous model; efficiency.**ainvoke() and astream() enable asynchronous execution; non-blocking for concurrent workflow processing.|
|**[[ainvoke() Method]]**|Describe the async equivalent of invoke() for non-blocking single runs.**ainvoke(); async method; await; non-blocking; single run; async/await syntax; asynchronous invocation; async pattern.**Call await compiled_graph.ainvoke(input_dict) to execute the graph asynchronously and wait for completion.|
|**[[astream() Method]]**|Explain the async equivalent of stream() for streaming results.**astream(); async iterator; async for; incremental output; asynchronous streaming; event streaming; async iteration; async pattern.**Call async for event in compiled_graph.astream(input_dict) to stream results asynchronously.|
|**[[async/await Syntax]]**|Show the async/await pattern for asynchronous execution.**async def; await; async context; syntax; pattern; coroutine; awaitable; asynchronous programming; modern Python.**Use async def to define async functions; use await for ainvoke()/astream(); enables non-blocking execution.|
|**[[Non-Blocking Execution Model]]**|Describe that async methods don't block during I/O operations.**Non-blocking; event loop; concurrent tasks; I/O efficiency; yield control; task switching; concurrency model; efficiency gain.**Async methods release control during I/O waits; other tasks can execute concurrently on event loop.|
|**[[Concurrent Graph Execution]]**|Show running multiple graph instances concurrently with async.**Concurrent execution; multiple instances; asyncio.gather(); task concurrency; parallel-like; throughput; scalability improvement.**Run multiple graphs concurrently: gather tasks with asyncio.gather() for concurrent processing of workflows.|

|**[[Async Nodes vs Sync Nodes]]**|Explain mixing async and sync nodes in a graph.**Async nodes; sync nodes; mixing; compatibility; async runner; wrapper; compatible execution; hybrid graphs.**Graphs can mix async and sync nodes; async runner handles both; wrappers convert between types as needed.**
|**[[Performance of Async Execution]]**|Describe performance benefits of async for I/O-bound workflows.**I/O efficiency; throughput improvement; latency hiding; concurrent execution; scalability; performance gain; use case dependent.**Async improves throughput for I/O-bound workflows; enables concurrent execution of multiple graphs efficiently.|
|**[[Async Libraries in Nodes]]**|Show using async libraries (aiohttp, asyncpg) in async nodes.**Async libraries; aiohttp; asyncpg; async database; async HTTP; non-blocking I/O; async ecosystem; integration.**Use async-compatible libraries in async nodes: aiohttp for HTTP, asyncpg for databases, etc.|
|**[[Error Handling in Async Execution]]**|Describe exception handling in async methods.**try/except in async; exception propagation; error handling; await error handling; graceful failure; error recovery patterns.**Exception handling in async methods works like sync; wrap await calls in try/except for error handling.|
|**[[Context Manager Usage (async)]]**|Show async context managers for resource management.**async with; async context managers; resource cleanup; async open(); async transactions; resource safety; cleanup guarantee.**Use async context managers: async with aiohttp.ClientSession() for safe resource lifecycle management.**
|**[[Mixing ainvoke with invoke]]**|Explain when to use each method in applications.**When to use async; when to use sync; context dependent; framework integration; async-first design; selection criteria.**Use ainvoke() in async contexts; invoke() in sync contexts; select based on application architecture.**
|**[[Performance Profiling of Async]]**|Describe measuring async execution performance.**Profiling async; task timing; concurrency metrics; throughput; latency; profiling tools; measurement; optimization targeting.**Profile async execution: measure task concurrency, identify bottlenecks, optimize hot paths; measure improvements.|
