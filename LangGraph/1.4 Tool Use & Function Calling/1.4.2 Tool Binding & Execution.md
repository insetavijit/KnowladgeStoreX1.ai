Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.4.2 Tool Binding & Execution]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.4.2.1 Tool Binding & Execution Overview]]**|Using tools in agents|tool binding, tool execution, LLM integration, function calling|Tool binding connects tools to LLMs; tool execution runs tools based on LLM function calls.|
|**[[1.4.2.2 Binding Tools to LLMs]]**|Tool connection|bind_tools, tool binding, LLM tool connection, function calling setup|Binding tools to LLMs makes tools available for LLM function calling during agent execution.|
|**[[1.4.2.3 Tool Invocation]]**|Calling tools|tool invocation, function calling, tool calls, executing tools|Tool invocation executes tools when LLMs make function calls during agent reasoning.|
|**[[1.4.2.4 ToolExecutor]]**|Tool execution handler|ToolExecutor, tool execution, executor pattern, tool runner|ToolExecutor handles execution of tools called by LLMs during agent workflows.|
|**[[1.4.2.5 Executing Tool Calls]]**|Running tools|tool call execution, function call handling, tool execution flow, call processing|Executing tool calls processes LLM function call requests and runs the corresponding tools.|
|**[[1.4.2.6 Tool Results]]**|Tool outputs|tool results, return values, tool outputs, result handling|Tool results contain outputs from executed tools, returned to LLMs for continued reasoning.|
|**[[1.4.2.7 Error Handling]]**|Tool error management|error handling, tool failures, exception handling, error recovery|Error handling manages failures during tool execution, preventing agent crashes.|
|**[[1.4.2.8 Timeout Handling]]**|Execution timeouts|timeout handling, tool timeouts, execution limits, timeout management|Timeout handling prevents tools from hanging by limiting execution time for tool calls.|
|**[[1.4.2.9 Tool Binding Patterns]]**|Common binding approaches|binding patterns, tool setup, connection patterns, binding strategies|Common patterns include binding at LLM initialization, dynamic binding, and conditional binding.|
|**[[1.4.2.10 Execution Flow]]**|Tool execution sequence|execution flow, call sequence, tool workflow, execution pipeline|Tool execution flow describes how LLM calls lead to tool execution and result integration.|
|**[[1.4.2.11 Async Tool Execution]]**|Asynchronous tools|async tools, async execution, concurrent tools, non-blocking tools|Async tool execution enables non-blocking tool calls for improved performance.|
|**[[1.4.2.12 Binding & Execution Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready tool use|reliable binding, error resilience, timeout configuration, result validation|Bind tools reliably, handle errors gracefully, configure timeouts appropriately, and validate results.|
