Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.1.4 Project Structure]]**, aligned with your prior learning structure.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Project Structure**|Design a scalable, maintainable folder layout for LangGraph agent projects.|Separation of concerns; modular architecture; configuration; naming conventions; scalability.|Clean structure keeps agent projects maintainable.|
|**[[Flat vs Modular Layout]]**|Compare simple single-file projects with structured multi-module projects.|Monolithic setup for prototypes; modules for production; trade-offs; growth paths; refactoring.|Start flat for prototypes, evolve to modular for production systems.|
|**[[src/ Directory Convention]]**|Explain the popular src/ layout and its benefits for packaging and imports.|src/agent, src/nodes, src/tools; import behavior; editable installs; relative imports; namespace clarity.|src/ layout isolates source code for cleaner packaging and testing.|
|**[[Organizing Nodes]]**|Structure node definitions logically for reusability and clarity.|Dedicated modules per node; node_library directories; stateless vs stateful nodes; naming; composability.|Group related nodes in modules to reduce cognitive load.|
|**[[Tool & Integration Modules]]**|Organize external tool definitions and API integrations separately.|tools/ directory; tool_base.py; integration adapters; third-party API wrappers; initialization.|Tools isolated in modules keep graph definitions clean and reusable.|
|**[[Configuration & Settings]]**|Manage configuration across environments using config modules and files.|config.py; environment-specific configs; dataclasses/pydantic for type-safe configs; secrets handling; overrides.|Centralized configs adapt code to different environments easily.|
|**[[State Schema Definitions]]**|Define typed state in dedicated modules for clarity and reusability.|state.py or models.py; TypedDict vs dataclass; annotations; validation; documentation.|A single source of truth for state schema prevents mismatches.|
|**[[Graph Definition Module]]**|Organize graph builder code for clarity and testability.|graph.py or builder.py; builder pattern; graph factory functions; version control; composition.|Separate graph definition from node logic for clarity.|
|**[[Dependencies & Imports]]**|Manage imports cleanly to avoid circular dependencies and reduce coupling.|Local imports; absolute imports; __init__.py usage; lazy loading; dependency injection; type hints.|Clean imports make dependencies explicit and refactoring easier.|
|**[[Testing Directory Structure]]**|Organize test code mirroring source structure for coverage and maintenance.|tests/ directory; test_nodes.py, test_graphs.py; fixtures; test data; conftest.py; coverage tracking.|Mirror source structure in tests for intuitive test organization.|
|**[[Entrypoint & CLI]]**|Create main.py or cli.py as project entry points for execution.|main.py as application entry; click/argparse for CLI; initialization; logging setup; error handling.|A clear entry point makes the project easy to run and understand.|
|**[[Logging & Monitoring]]**|Centralize logging configuration and monitoring setup in a dedicated module.|logging/ directory; handlers; formatters; LangSmith integration; debug vs production logs.|Centralized logging provides visibility without scattering log calls.|
|**[[Data & Fixtures]]**|Organize test data, sample prompts, and reusable fixtures.|data/ directory; fixtures for test graphs; mock data; sample inputs; versioning of test data.|Organized test data makes tests reproducible and maintainable.|
|**[[Documentation & Examples]]**|Structure documentation and runnable examples clearly.|examples/ directory; README.md at each level; docstrings; tutorials; architecture diagrams.|Clear examples help onboarding and demonstrate best practices.|
|**[[Environment Files & Secrets]]**|Handle .env files, .gitignore, and secrets safely.|Standard .env structure; .env.example; .gitignore rules; secret managers; no secrets in git.|Never commit secrets; use .env.example as template for team setup.|
|**[[CI/CD & Deployment]]**|Organize deployment and continuous integration artifacts and scripts.|Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .github/workflows, k8s manifests; deployment scripts; CI config.|Infrastructure-as-code makes deployments reproducible.|
|**[[Versioning & Releases]]**|Structure version information, changelog, and release artifacts.|pyproject.toml or setup.py; version strings; CHANGELOG.md; semantic versioning; tags in git.|Semantic versioning communicates breaking changes clearly.|
