Below is a **similar-styled, interview-focused table** for **[[1.1.6.3 Branching Patterns]]**, covering conditional routing and decision trees.

|**Section**|**Interview Learning Goals**|**Key Technical Details to Study**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Branching Patterns Overview**|Explain conditional execution based on state or decisions.**Branching; conditional routing; decision making; if-then-else; multiple paths; flow control; dynamic routing; conditional execution.**Branching patterns route execution to different nodes based on conditions; enable dynamic decision making.|
|**[[If-Then-Else Branching]]**|Show implementing classic if-then-else logic.**Conditional edge; routing function; two branches; decision point; condition checking; binary choice; simple branching.**Implement with conditional edge: routing function evaluates condition, returns target node name; route to different nodes.|
|**[[Multi-Way Branching]]**|Describe routing to more than two branches.**Multi-way routing; multiple branches; n-way branching; many paths; multiple targets; complex decisions; sophisticated routing.**Conditional edge can route to many nodes: routing function returns target based on multiple conditions.|
|**[[Routing Function Pattern]]**|Show implementing custom routing functions.**Routing function; decision logic; state inspection; logic evaluation; function signature; implementation; custom logic; function design.**Routing functions: take state as input, evaluate condition, return next node name; implement custom decision logic.|
|**[[State-Based Branching]]**|Explain using state values to determine routing.**State inspection; state values; condition evaluation; state fields; decision based on state; state-driven routing; dynamic behavior.**Inspect state in routing function: check field values, flags, counts; route based on state content dynamically.**
|**[[Error Handling Branches]]**|Show routing to different nodes on success/failure.**Error branching; success/failure paths; error handling routing; graceful degradation; fallback paths; error recovery; alternative paths.**Route to error handler on exception: routing function checks error status, routes to recovery or failure node.**
|**[[Parallel Branches with Synchronization]]**|Describe branching to parallel paths that converge.**Parallel branches; merge; synchronization; join; parallel execution; convergence; concurrency; combined results.**Branch to parallel nodes; use synchronization node to wait for all; combine results; continue after merge.**
|**[[Decision Tree Patterns]]**|Show nested branching for complex decisions.**Decision trees; nested branching; complex logic; multiple levels; hierarchy; sequential decisions; layered decisions; sophistication.**Implement decision trees: initial branch, followed by more branches in branches; handle complex decision hierarchies.|
|**[[Branching Performance Implications]]**|Describe performance of branching patterns.**Performance; parallel efficiency; branch overhead; latency; throughput; critical path; execution time; performance analysis.**Branching improves throughput: parallel branches can execute concurrently; total time ≤ longest branch + merge overhead.|
|**[[Condition Evaluation Order]]**|Explain routing function logic and condition precedence.**Condition evaluation; precedence; order; logic; short-circuit; efficiency; correctness; evaluation strategy.**Condition order matters; evaluate in priority order; short-circuit expensive checks; efficient logic patterns.|
|**[[Default/Fallback Branching]]**|Show implementing default paths when conditions don't match.**Default branch; fallback; catch-all; error path; unexpected cases; handling edge cases; default routing; safety net.**Add catch-all: if no conditions match, route to default; handles unexpected cases gracefully; safety provision.**
|**[[Type-Safe Branching in TypeScript/Python]]**|Describe using types to ensure valid routing.**Type safety; routing validation; literal types; type checking; valid destinations; static checking; type safety guarantee.**Use Literal types for valid node names; mypy validates routing function returns valid targets; prevents typos.**
|**[[Testing Branching Logic]]**|Describe testing branching patterns comprehensively.**Test coverage; all branches; edge cases; condition testing; routing verification; test strategy; comprehensive testing; coverage assurance.**Test all branches: normal path, error path, edge cases; verify routing function behavior; test synchronization.**
|**[[Composition with Linear Workflows]]**|Show combining branching with linear workflows.**Composition; pattern combination; nesting; hybrid patterns; building blocks; complex workflows; sophisticated behavior.**Combine: linear workflows on each branch; complex patterns emerge from simple building blocks; modularity.**
|**[[Complex Conditional Logic]]**|Explain handling sophisticated conditions.**Complex conditions; multiple criteria; AND/OR logic; boolean logic; sophisticated routing; nuanced decisions; logic operators.**For complex logic: evaluate multiple conditions, combine with AND/OR; keep routing functions focused; refactor if too complex.|

Next, we'll cover **[[1.1.6.4 Looping Patterns]]** for iterative execution.
