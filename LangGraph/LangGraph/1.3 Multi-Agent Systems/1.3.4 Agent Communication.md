|**[[1.3.4.7 Communication Channels]]**|Channel patterns|communication channels, channel types, message channels, routing channels|Communication channels define pathways and patterns for agent messaging and coordination.|
|**[[1.3.4.8 Broadcast Communication]]**|One-to-many messaging|broadcast, multicast, one-to-many, notification patterns|Broadcast communication enables agents to send messages to multiple recipients simultaneously.|
|**[[1.3.4.9 Message Routing]]**|Directing messages|message routing, routing logic, message delivery, targeted messaging|Message routing directs messages to appropriate agents based on content, context, or rules.|
|**[[1.3.4.10 Communication Patterns]]**|Common patterns|request-response, publish-subscribe, event-driven, polling patterns|Common communication patterns include request-response, pub-sub, and event-driven messaging.|
|**[[1.3.4.11 Synchronous vs Async Communication]]**|Communication timing|sync communication, async communication, blocking, non-blocking|Communication can be synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking) depending on needs.|
