Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.2.6 Shared vs Local State]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.2.6.1 Shared vs Local State Overview]]**|State scoping|shared state, local state, state scope, state isolation|Understanding state scoping helps decide what to share globally vs keep node-local.|
|**[[1.2.6.2 Graph-Level State]]**|Shared global state|graph state, shared state, global state, cross-node state|Graph-level state is shared across all nodes, accessible and modifiable by any node.|
|**[[1.2.6.3 Node-Local Variables]]**|Isolated node state|local variables, function scope, node isolation, temporary state|Node-local variables exist only within node function scope, isolated from graph state.|
|**[[1.2.6.4 State Scope]]**|Understanding scope|state scope, visibility, access rules, scope boundaries|State scope determines where state values are accessible—global graph scope or local node scope.|
|**[[1.2.6.5 State Isolation]]**|Isolating state|isolation strategies, private state, encapsulation, state boundaries|State isolation prevents unintended access and modification, improving safety and clarity.|
|**[[1.2.6.6 When to Share vs Isolate]]**|Design decisions|sharing decisions, isolation decisions, state design, scope choices|Share state for cross-node communication; isolate for temporary or node-specific data.|
|**[[1.2.6.7 Performance Considerations]]**|State performance|state size, performance impact, shared overhead, local efficiency|Large shared state affects all nodes; local state has minimal overhead and better performance.|
|**[[1.2.6.8 State Visibility]]**|Access patterns|state access, read access, write access, visibility rules|Graph state is visible to all nodes; local variables are visible only within their function.|
|**[[1.2.6.9 State Mutation Safety]]**|Safe state handling|mutation safety, immutable state, state updates, safe patterns|Graph state appears immutable; nodes return updates rather than mutating state directly.|
|**[[1.2.6.10 Scoping Patterns]]**|Common patterns|global data, local computation, shared results, temporary values|Common patterns include global shared data, local computation variables, and shared results.|
|**[[1.2.6.11 State Encapsulation]]**|Encapsulating state|encapsulation, information hiding, state privacy, controlled access|Encapsulation limits state access to prevent unintended modifications and improve maintainability.|
|**[[1.2.6.12 Scoping Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready scoping|minimal sharing, clear scope, appropriate isolation, documentation|Minimize shared state, maintain clear scope boundaries, isolate appropriately, and document scoping decisions.|
