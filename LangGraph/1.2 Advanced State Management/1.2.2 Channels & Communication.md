Below is a matching topics table for **[[1.2.2 Channels & Communication]]**, following the same structure and depth as your earlier modules:

|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.2.2.1 Channels & Communication Overview]]**|Channel concept|channels, state channels, communication patterns, data flow|Channels define how state fields are stored, updated, and communicated between nodes.|
|**[[1.2.2.2 LastValue Channel]]**|Last-wins channel|LastValue, single value storage, overwrite behavior, latest value|LastValue channels store the most recent value, overwriting previous values.|
|**[[1.2.2.3 BinaryOperatorAggregate]]**|Aggregation channel|BinaryOperatorAggregate, reduce operations, custom aggregation, accumulate|BinaryOperatorAggregate channels combine values using binary operations like add or custom functions.|
|**[[1.2.2.4 Topic Channels]]**|Topic-based channels|Topic channels, message topics, topic routing, pub-sub patterns|Topic channels organize messages by topics, enabling structured communication patterns.|
|**[[1.2.2.5 State Channels]]**|Channel configuration|state channels, channel types, channel setup, channel binding|State channels define how state fields behave, determining update and access patterns.|
|**[[1.2.2.6 Cross-Node Communication]]**|Inter-node messaging|node communication, state sharing, message passing, data exchange|Channels enable nodes to communicate by reading and writing shared state fields.|
|**[[1.2.2.7 Channel Selection]]**|Choosing channel types|channel selection, use case matching, channel characteristics|Select channels based on data semantics—LastValue for flags, aggregates for collections.|
|**[[1.2.2.8 Custom Channels]]**|Creating channels|custom channel classes, channel implementation, specialized channels|Custom channels enable specialized communication patterns for specific use cases.|
|**[[1.2.2.9 Channel Performance]]**|Channel efficiency|channel overhead, performance impact, efficient channels, optimization|Channel choice affects performance; use appropriate channels for your data patterns.|
|**[[1.2.2.10 Channel Patterns]]**|Common channel usage|message lists, counters, flags, aggregates, communication patterns|Common patterns include LastValue for flags, BinaryOperatorAggregate for lists, Topic for messages.|
|**[[1.2.2.11 Channel Integration]]**|Combining channels|multiple channels, channel composition, mixed patterns, channel coordination|Graphs can use multiple channel types together for different state fields.|
|**[[1.2.2.12 Channel Best Practices & Pitfalls]]**|Production-ready channels|appropriate selection, clear semantics, testing, documentation|Choose channels that match data semantics, document channel behavior, and test thoroughly.|
