|**Section**|**Focus**|**Key Utilities / Concepts**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.1.2.1 Architecture Overview]]**|Structural framing|modular components, perception–think–act loop, data flow, separation of concerns|Agent architecture defines how perception, reasoning, and action modules are organized and connected.|
|**[[1.1.2.2 Perception / Input Processing]]**|Ingress & grounding|prompt construction, context assembly, parsing, retrieval, sensor/API inputs|Perception converts raw inputs into structured context the agent can reason over.|
|**[[1.1.2.3 Memory Systems]]**|Context persistence|short-term memory, long-term memory, vector stores, episodic logs, state tracking|Memory allows agents to retain context and learn across steps or sessions.|
|**[[1.1.2.4 Planning & Decomposition]]**|Deliberation layer|task breakdown, subgoals, chain-of-thought, tree search, planners|Planning decomposes goals into executable steps the agent can follow.|
|**[[1.1.2.5 Action & Tool Execution]]**|External actuation|API calls, code execution, function calling, environment actions, tool selection|Actions let the agent affect the world through tools and APIs.|
|**[[1.1.2.6 Reflection & Self-Improvement]]**|Meta-reasoning|critique, error analysis, retries, memory updates, self-evaluation|Reflection helps agents analyze outcomes and improve future behavior.|
|**[[1.1.2.7 Control Loop / Agent Loop]]**|Runtime orchestration|sense–think–act cycle, termination conditions, iteration control, budget limits|The agent loop drives continuous perception, reasoning, and action until completion.|
|**[[1.1.2.8 Stateful vs Stateless Agents]]**|State management model|persistent state, session memory, context windows, reset behavior|Stateful agents retain history; stateless agents start fresh each run.|
|**[[1.1.2.9 Control Flow Patterns]]**|Execution topology|linear chains, branching, DAGs, loops, event-driven flow, graph execution|Control flow patterns define how decisions and steps are routed at runtime.|
|**[[1.1.2.10 End-to-End Agent Structure]]**|System integration|component wiring, data contracts, orchestration layer, failure handling|An agent is an integrated system where components cooperate to achieve goals.|
