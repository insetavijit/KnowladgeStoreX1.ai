| **Section**                               | **Interview Learning Goals**                                                 | **Key Technical Details to Study**                                                        | **One-Line Recall**                                                       |

| **Multiple Sites & Cloning Overview**     | Explain why managing multiple local sites matters in professional workflows. | Parallel projects; isolation; reuse; faster onboarding; consistency across builds.        | Multiple local sites enable parallel development and standardized setups. |
| **[[Managing Multiple Local Sites]]**     | Describe how tools support many WordPress installs.                          | Site lists in Local/DevKinsta; ports & hosts; naming conventions; resource isolation.     | Local tools let you run many WordPress sites side by side.                |
| **[[Cloning a Site]]**                    | Explain how to duplicate a WordPress site locally.                           | File copy + DB dump; built-in clone features; search/replace after clone; path updates.   | Cloning reproduces a site’s files and data for reuse or testing.          |
| **[[Blueprints & Templates]]**            | Describe blueprint-based project bootstrapping.                              | Base themes/plugins; prefilled content; exportable templates; tool-specific blueprints.   | Blueprints create repeatable starting points for new sites.               |
| **[[WordPress Multisite Networks]]**      | Distinguish multisite from multiple separate installs.                       | Network setup; shared core; site tables; domain vs subdirectory; use cases.               | Multisite manages many sites from a single WordPress install.             |
| **[[When to Use Multisite vs Clones]]**   | Justify architectural choice.                                                | Content sharing; update scope; isolation needs; client separation; complexity trade-offs. | Choose multisite for shared ecosystems, clones for isolated projects.     |
| **[[Syncing & Propagation]]**             | Explain how changes move across copies.                                      | Theme/plugin propagation; DB sync; selective migrations; avoiding content overwrite.      | Sync keeps clones aligned without losing local changes.                   |
| **[[Resource & Performance Management]]** | Discuss running many sites on one machine.                                   | CPU/RAM limits; container counts; pausing sites; disk usage; cleanup.                     | Resource control keeps multi-site setups stable.                          |
| **[[Versioning Blueprints]]**             | Show how templates evolve over time.                                         | Git for base site; semantic versions; changelogs; update process.                         | Versioned blueprints ensure consistent project starts.                    |
| **[[Automation & Tooling]]**              | Highlight automation for spinning up sites.                                  | WP-CLI site creation; scripts; Docker compose; tool APIs.                                 | Automation reduces setup time for new sites to minutes.                   |
| **[[Common Pitfalls]]**                   | Identify mistakes in cloning and multisite setups.                           | Hardcoded URLs; license conflicts; user creds reuse; media bloat; multisite misfit.       | Most issues come from poor cleanup and wrong architecture choice.         |
