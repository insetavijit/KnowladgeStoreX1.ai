|---|---|---|---|
|**[[1.1.3.1 Taxonomy Overview]]**|Classification framing|agent families, behavior-based grouping, capability-based types, use-case mapping|Agent taxonomy groups agents by behavior and capabilities to match them to problems.|
|**[[1.1.3.2 Conversational Agents]]**|Dialogue-centric agents|chat memory, turn-taking, intent handling, persona, context management|Conversational agents focus on natural dialogue and user interaction.|
|**[[1.1.3.3 Function-Calling Agents]]**|API-driven execution|structured outputs, JSON schemas, tool routing, deterministic calls|Function-calling agents invoke predefined APIs based on model decisions.|
|**[[1.1.3.4 ReAct Agents]]**|Reason–act loop|thought–action–observation cycles, stepwise reasoning, tool feedback|ReAct agents interleave reasoning with actions to solve multi-step tasks.|
|**[[1.1.3.5 Reflection Agents]]**|Self-critique loop|self-evaluation, retries, memory updates, critique prompts|Reflection agents improve performance by analyzing and correcting their own outputs.|
|**[[1.1.3.6 Tool-Using Agents]]**|External capability use|search tools, browsers, code exec, calculators, planners, environment APIs|Tool-using agents extend LLMs by acting through external systems.|
|**[[1.1.3.7 Planning Agents]]**|Deliberative control|goal decomposition, subtask graphs, plan–execute–replan, tree-of-thought|Planning agents explicitly construct and follow plans to reach goals.|
|**[[1.1.3.8 Research Agents]]**|Information synthesis|search, retrieval, citation, summarization, fact-checking|Research agents gather and synthesize information from multiple sources.|
|**[[1.1.3.9 Coding Agents]]**|Software automation|code generation, tests, debugging, repo navigation, execution loops|Coding agents write, run, and refine code to complete programming tasks.|
|**[[1.1.3.10 Matching Type to Use Case]]**|Selection strategy|task complexity, autonomy need, determinism, cost, risk|Choose agent types based on task goals, constraints, and required autonomy.|
|**[[1.1.3.11 Hybrid / Composite Agents]]**|Multi-pattern systems|combined behaviors, layered agents, role-based subagents, orchestration|Hybrid agents combine multiple patterns to handle complex real-world workflows.|
