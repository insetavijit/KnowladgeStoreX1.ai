| **[[1.1.1.1 Local Environment Tools]]**            | Primary local dev platforms    | LocalWP, DevKinsta, Studio by WordPress.com, Docker-based wp-env, XAMPP/MAMP      | Local dev tools provide isolated, reproducible WordPress stacks for offline development.   |
| **[[1.1.1.2 WordPress Installation & Structure]]** | Core install & file system     | WordPress core, theme & plugin directories, `wp-config.php`, content organization | WordPress folder structure and config files define site behavior and environment settings. |

| **[[1.1.1.4 Multiple Sites & Cloning]]**           | Managing more than one site    | Multi-site networks, cloning, blueprints, repeatable templates                    | Clone or blueprint local sites to standardize setups across projects.                      |
| **[[1.1.1.5 WP-CLI & Command Line]]**              | Shell-based automation         | WP-CLI core commands, custom scripts, site bootstrap, plugin/theme actions        | Use WP-CLI to automate WordPress tasks via scripts instead of UI clicks.                   |

| **[[1.1.1.7 Version Control Integration]]**        | Source control & collaboration | Git, branching, `.gitignore`, commit conventions, feature branches                | Git enforces version tracking, branch isolation, and team collaboration.                   |
| **[[1.1.1.8 Staging & Workflow Pipelines]]**       | Dev-Staging-Production flow    | Push/pull workflows, staging hosts, CI/CD, deployment scripts                     | Structured pipelines reduce risks by testing changes in staging before live.               |
| **[[1.1.1.9 Performance & Environment Parity]]**   | Matches local with production  | PHP version, DB config, caching, SSL, server stack parity                         | True dev environments mirror production PHP, SSL, caching, and server modules.             |
| **[[1.1.1.10 Deployment Checklists & Standards]]** | Pre-launch validation          | backups, QA testing, error logs, dependency versions, rollback plans              | A deployment checklist  catches issues, and prepares rollback paths.                       |

### Summary of Key Updates (2025)

**1. Modern Local Tools:**

- **LocalWP** remains a primary GUI tool with one-click setups, hot-swap PHP, WP-CLI, and sync features. ([Local](https://localwp.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Local - Local WordPress development made simple"))
    
- **DevKinsta** uses Docker containers, built-in DB tools, multi-site support, and direct push/pull to hosting. ([Kinsta®](https://kinsta.com/devkinsta/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DevKinsta – Your Free Local WordPress Development Suite"))
    
- **Studio by WordPress.com** adds dependency-free setups and innovative preview sharing (e.g., preview URLs, simplified environments). ([wpdeveloper.com](https://wpdeveloper.com/studio-by-wordpress-com-to-develop-sites-locally/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Studio by WordPress.com: A Fast & Free Way to Develop ..."))
    
- **Docker/wp-env** and environment-agnostic stacks are increasingly used for parity with production environments. ([Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/local-development-environment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Local development environment"))
    

**2. Database & Multi-Site Workflows:**  
Integrated DB tools in DevKinsta and LocalWP simplify inspection and migrations without external tools. Cloning and “blueprints” standardize repeatable builds for multiple local sites. ([Local](https://localwp.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Local - Local WordPress development made simple"))

**3. Debugging, CLI, & Version Control:**  
Standardizing `WP_DEBUG`, using Xdebug or browser dev tools for JS/PHP, and integrating Git are essential for collaborative, maintainable development workflows. ([Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/local-development-environment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Local development environment"))

**4. Staging Pipelines & Deployment:**  
Professional workflows include moving code from local → staging → production with push/pull integrations (e.g., managed hosts, CI/CD), backed by checklists covering backups, tests, logs, and rollback plans.
